			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll notice about 2.7 is its new interface. From the top down, we&#8217;ve listened to your feedback and thought deeply about the design and the result is a WordPress that&#8217;s just plain faster. Nearly every task you do on your blog will <strong>take fewer clicks and be faster</strong> in 2.7 than it did in a previous version. (<a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">Download it now</a>, or read on for more.)</p>
<p>Next you&#8217;ll begin to notice the new features subtly sprinkled through the new interface: the new dashboard that you can arrange with drag and drop to put the things most important to you on top, QuickPress, comment threading, paging, and the ability to reply to comments from your dashboard, the ability to install any plugin directly from WordPress.org with a single click, and sticky posts.</p>
<p>Digging in further you might notice that every screen is customizable. Let&#8217;s say you never care about author on your post listings &#8212; just click &#8220;Screen Options&#8221; and uncheck it and it&#8217;s instantly gone from the page. The same for any module on the dashboard or write screen. If your screen is narrow and the menu is taking up too much horizontal room, click the arrow to minimize it to be icon-only, and then go to the write page and drag and drop everything from the right column into the main one, so your posting area is full-screen. (For example I like hiding everything except categories, tags, and publish. I put categories and tags on the right, and publish under the post box.)</p>
<p>For a visual introduction to what 2.7 is, check out this video (available in HD, and full screen):</p>
<p><object width="640" height="360" data="http://v.wordpress.com/hFr8Nyar" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"><param name="src" value="http://v.wordpress.com/hFr8Nyar" /><param name="allowfullscreen" value="true" /></object></p>
<p>It&#8217;s all about you. It&#8217;s the next generation of WordPress, which is why we&#8217;ve bestowed it with the honor of being named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Coltrane">John Coltrane</a>. <a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">And you can download it today</a>.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, this may be the <strong>last time you ever have to manually upgrade WordPress again</strong>. We heard how tired you were of doing upgrades for yourself and your friends, so now WordPress includes a built-in upgrade that will automatically notify you of new releases, and when you&#8217;re ready it will download them, install them, and upgrade your blog with a single click.</p>
<p>(As with any interface change it may take a little bit of time to acclimate yourself but soon you&#8217;ll find yourself whizzing through the screens. Even people who have hated it at first tell us after a few days they wonder how they got by before.)</p>
<h3>The Story Behind 2.7</h3>
<p>The real reason Coltrane is such a huge leap forward is because the community was so involved with every step of the process. <strong>Over 150 people contributed code directly to the release</strong>, our highest ever, with many tens of thousands more participating in the polls, surveys, tests, mailing lists, and other feedback mechanisms the WordPress dev team used in putting this release together.</p>

<p>This was interesting to us, a blogging software release we actually blogged about, but the process was hugely informative. Prior to its release today Crazyhorse and 2.7 had been tested by tens of thousands of people on their blogs, hundreds of thousands of you count .com. The volume of feedback was so high that we decided to push back the release date a month to take time to incorporate it all and do more revisions based on what you guys said.</p>
<p>For those of you wondering why we didn&#8217;t call this release 3.0, it&#8217;s because we abhor version number inflation. 3.0 will just be the next release after 2.9. The major features in new point releases approach also works well for products like OS X, with huge changes between a 10.3 and 10.4.</p>
<h3>The Future</h3>
<p>Those of you following along at home might have noticed this was our second major redesign of WordPress this year. Whoa nelly! While that wasn&#8217;t ideal, and I especially sympathize with those of you creating books or tutorials around WordPress, there&#8217;s good news. The changes to WordPress in 2.5 and 2.7 were necessary for us to break free of much of the legacy cruft and interface bloat that had built up over the years (gradually) and more importantly provide us with a UI framework and interface language we can use at the foundation to build tomorrow&#8217;s WordPress on, to express ideas we haven&#8217;t been able to before. So at the end of 2009 I expect, interface-wise, WordPress to look largely the same as it does now.</p>
<p>That said, we couldn&#8217;t be more excited about the future with regards to features. Now that we&#8217;ve cleared out more basic things, we are looking forward in the coming year to really tackling media handling including audio and video, better tools for plugin and theme developers, widgets, theme updates, more integrated and contextual help, and easier integration with projects like <a href="http://buddypress.org/">BuddyPress</a> and <a href="http://bbpress.org/">bbPress</a>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There comes a time in every WordPress release when it&#8217;s ready for the world , to come out of its cocoon and feel the light of the world on its wings for the first time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not quite that time yet, but we&#8217;re as close as we&#8217;ve ever been, hence the <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.7-RC2.zip">immediate availability of 2.7 Release Candidate 2, or RC2 for short</a>.</p>
<p>Of course if you were already testing 2.7, you can just use the built-in core updater (Tools > Upgrade) to download and install RC2 for you (and later upgrade you to the final release when it&#8217;s available) but if not you can use the download link above.</p>
<p>We feel this release is pretty much exactly what we&#8217;re going to ship as 2.7, barring any final bugs or polish tweaks that you report or we find.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">WordPress 2.6.5 is immediately available and fixes one security problem and three bugs</a>. We recommend everyone upgrade to this release.</p>
<p>The security issue is an XSS exploit discovered by Jeremias Reith that fortunately only affects IP-based virtual servers running on Apache 2.x. If you are interested only in the security fix, copy <code>wp-includes/feed.php</code> and <code>wp-includes/version.php</code> from the 2.6.5 release package.</p>
<p>2.6.5 contains three other small fixes in addition to the XSS fix. The first prevents accidentally saving post meta information to a revision. The second prevents XML-RPC from fetching incorrect post types. The third adds some user ID sanitization during bulk delete requests. For a list of changed files, consult the <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/changeset?old_path=tags%2F2.6.3&amp;old=&amp;new_path=tags%2F2.6.5&amp;new=">full changeset</a> between 2.6.3 and 2.6.5.</p>
<p>Note that we are skipping version 2.6.4 and jumping from 2.6.3 to 2.6.5 to avoid confusion with a fake 2.6.4 release that made the rounds. There is not and never will be a version 2.6.4.</p>
<p><a href="http://wordpress.org/download/">Get WordPress 2.6.5</a>.</p>

The winner of Project Icon, with 35% of the votes, is Entry ID &#8220;BD,&#8221; otherwise known as Ben Dunkle. Congratulations, Ben! The runner-up was VS, otherwise known as Verena Segert, so we&#8217;ll be attaching that set to the alternate color palette that is selectable from the profile screen. As we prepare for RC1, Ben and Verena will be revising a couple of their icons so that both sets will use the same metaphors, creating the colored &#8220;on&#8221; states, and creating the larger size of each icon for use in the h2 screen headers. We are very grateful to have had the opportunity to select from so many great options, and would like to express again our appreciation for all the designers who participated in the contest. Thanks also to the more than 3700 people who completed the voting survey and took the time to weigh on on the individual icon sets.</p>

<p>Question 20 was not mandatory, so a few hundred people skipped it, but the responses we did get (3366 of them) reinforced the fact that the two most popular sets were also the most popular 2nd choices, which made the decision of the judges to go with the popular vote an easy one (take that, electoral college!).</p>
<p>A few of the individual icon metaphors also had a significant lead over the other choices.<br />
<strong>Dashboard:</strong> 1333 voters (40%) chose a house as the best metaphor. We agree, so both Ben and Verena will be replacing their Dashboard icons.</p>
<p><strong>Media:</strong> 2097 voters (65%) chose the combination camera + musical note icon, which was part of Ben&#8217;s set. We also really loved it, and Verena will amend her media icon to incorporate this idea.</p>
<p><strong>Plugins: </strong>1682 voters (53%) selected the outlet plug metaphor, which both Ben and Verena used in their sets.</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> 1581 voters (49%) liked the combination of two tools better than anything else, so Ben and Verena will try this approach.</p>
<p>So those are the results, and soon you&#8217;ll see the new icons coming to a 2.7 installation near you.</p>
<p>Need another look at the entries to remember which one you liked best? Here are some reminder images, as well as the identity of each set&#8217;s creator.</p>

Her blue icons received more specific voter comments than the gray ones, so we&#8217;re planning the second color palette to be in shades of blue so that we can use the blue icon set.</td>

One of his sets came in third while the other came in last, but whether you only look at the higher scoring set or you combine their votes, Guillaume had the next highest percentage of votes, and many people liked the metaphors he used for various icons. In fact, given the  enthusiasm of the community for Guillaume&#8217;s icons, we think a great plugin would be one that would allow the user to upload the icon set of their choice. Any volunteers?</td>

</table>
<p>If you need to hire an icon designer any time soon, we highly recommend our Project Icon contestants, who all delivered great work in a very short timeframe. It was great to work with all of them, even for such a short assignment.</p>
<p>So, to sum up:</p>
<ol>
<li>The winning icon sets by Ben Dunkle and Verena Segert will be incorporated into WordPress 2.7 RC1.</li>
<li>Someone should write a plugin that would allow anyone to upload a custom icon set (I bet the other contestants could be convinced to release their icon sets for such a  purpose).</li>
<li>2.7 is still trucking away, but we can always use help with patches, especially for IE6! (I know, that wasn&#8217;t in the main post, but it&#8217;s true, so hmph)</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks again to everyone who participated in this experiment, and we hope you enjoyed it as much as we did. And congratulations again to Ben and Verena!</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier in the beta period, we put out a call here on the development blog for designers in the WordPress community who might be interested in designing custom icons for the 2.7 admin interface. Over a dozen icon designers from around the world responded, so rather than choose just one, we decided to turn the icon design assignment into a contest so that more people could participate and the community could have a vote in what the new icons should look like.</p>
<p>Once we decided to go with a contest format instead of a single-designer gig, about half the original volunteers changed their minds. The remaining designers each submitted two icons (Posts, Links) in their proposed style. At this stage a couple of designers were thanked for their submissions but eliminated from the competition because their icons were considered too far afield from the WordPress visual style. The remaining designers were given feedback on the icons they had submitted and given about a week to complete the icon set for the menu as well as the list/excerpt icons that are shown on the Edit Posts screen. All but one of these designers finished a complete set, giving us five sets in total.</p>
<p>So now we need to choose a direction. For each of the icon sets, we’ll show you the set itself, the designer’s introduction, and some feedback from the lead developers. After you’ve reviewed all five, place your vote for the set you think has the visual style that is the most suitable for WordPress 2.7. This will be followed by additional votes on specific icons, so if you like the specific image used in one set but like the style of another, you can vote to change the metaphor for a given icon. You’ll also be able to leave general feedback throughout the voting process. When voting has concluded, we’ll review the comments and the votes, and will declare a winner.</p>
<p>Things to bear in mind when making your selections:<br />
A week is not a long time to create 13 icons. The winning set will undergo a revision to be refined, and some icons may be substituted. We asked for all icons in grayscale for the contest. An “on” state and a larger size for screen headers will be designed by the winner. It seemed like too much work to have everyone do multiple states for so many icons.</p>
<p>Ready? <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Go and take the icon survey.</span> <span style="color: #888888;"><em>(The survey has now been closed.)</em></span> Voting will remain open for 48 hours from the time of this post to allow people from all time zones a chance to participate before we close the survey and make a decision (since we&#8217;d like to include the new icons in Beta 3).</p>
<p><strong>A Note Regarding the 2.7 Release Date:</strong><br />
As we approach Beta 3, bug tickets continue to be added to Trac, the pain of making things look good in IE6 continues to be felt, and the need to improve accessibility looms. If you love WordPress, are a decent coder, and want to contribute like these icon designers contributed, please consider contributing a patch to help with one of these efforts. Jump right in on <a href="http://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&amp;status=assigned&amp;status=reopened&amp;milestone=2.7">current Trac tickets</a>, or pop into the <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/wordpress-dev">#wordpress-dev IRC channel</a> to ask what to do.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The first public beta of WordPress 2.7 is here at last.  Join the thousands of people already testing 2.7 by <a href="http://wordpress.org/wordpress-2.7-beta1.zip">downloading 2.7 Beta 1</a>.  As previously mentioned on this blog, 2.7 is bringing a new visual design.  This design is almost completely implemented, but there are still a few areas that aren&#8217;t quite finished in Beta 1.  There are also several glitches in certain browsers.  Beta 1 provides the best experience in Firefox and Safari. Don&#8217;t worry, we are working on IE and Opera and will have those looking good in time for the final release.</p>
<p>Speaking of the final release, it will not be available on November 10th as originally scheduled.  We are two weeks behind schedule at the moment.  We need a little more time to finish the visual design, do a round of user testing against that finished design, and do a proper round of public beta testing. Our plan is to keep working as if Nov. 10 is still the release date.  However, instead of releasing the final 2.7 on the 10th, we will make a release candidate available instead.  The release candidate is intended to be a high-quality, almost-finished release that we are comfortable recommending for broad use.  After Nov. 10, the focus will be on fixing high impact bugs turned up by those of you testing the release candidate. I suspect 2.7 will be ready for final release by the end of November.  A specific date will be set as we progress through the public beta cycle and get a feel for how solid the release is.</p>
