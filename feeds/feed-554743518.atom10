	<description>x jeremy jarratt is a blogger, musician, artist, poet, web developer/designer, armchair philosophizer, teller of tales, and roustabout. Also, something he calls a "behavioral artist." (Not sure.) This is his latest home on teh internets - where he stores his swear words, when he's not hurling them at the sun in vain.</description>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I put together this YouTube playlist of Carl Sagan&#8217;s &#8220;You Are Here&#8221;/&#8221;Pale Blue Dot&#8221; speech. I highly recommend checking it out.<br />
<object classid="clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000" width="480" height="385" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0"><param name="src" value="http://www.youtube.com/p/3483E84DC5B20407" /><embed type="application/x-shockwave-flash" width="480" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/p/3483E84DC5B20407"></embed></object></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look again at that dot. That&#8217;s here. That&#8217;s home. That&#8217;s us. On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every &#8217;superstar,&#8217; every &#8217;supreme leader,&#8217; every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there – on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we&#8217;ve ever known.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ann Druyan suggest an experiment: Look back again at the pale blue dot of the preceding chapter. Take a good long look at it. Stare at the dot for any length of time and then try to convince yourself that God created the whole Universe for one of the 10 million or so species of life that inhabit that speck of dust. Now take it a step further: Imagine that everything was made just for a single shade of that species, or gender, or ethnic or religious subdivision. If this doesn&#8217;t strike you as unlikely, pick another dot. Imagine it to be inhabited by a different form of intelligent life. They, too, cherish the notion of a God who has created everything for their benefit. How seriously do you take their claim?&#8221;</p>
<p>- Carl Sagan</p></blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holly adopted two new chihuahuas, named John and Zooey. They&#8217;re three years old. They were rescued from abuse, which is always the best way to get a dog.

<p>Until i get my Flickr stream integrated here, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/transmothra/tags/dogs/" class="liflickr">you can click on over to see them</a>.</p>
<p>So far, Speck has been pretty kind, and puts up no fuss when they share his food. John, on the other hand, guards the community food dish zealously. The big fatass.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>omfg where do i start?</p>
<p>today sucked.</p>
<p>preface: we are so poor. that is all about that. we are poor, and it sucks balls. Holly works so hard, and for what? what the hell do i do to make the world any better? not a god damned thing. especially not her world.</p>
<p>on to the viewing&#8230;</p>
<p>my old friend is dead. younger than me, dead and gone. i remember yesterday when we were all young and crazy with life and the ecstasy of the world being at our fingertips.</p>
<p>i got there, alone. i killed time rolling a smoke and killing it. i rolled a couple more and walked up. almost immediately some cat comes up for a light. he&#8217;s a friend of Jason&#8217;s. there is some small talk, then he reveals that there are internal social problems &amp; factioning, a division going on. he calls it childish; &#8220;bizarre,&#8221; i reply.</p>
<p>after chatting with another of his more recent friends, i mustered up just barely enough guts to go inside. what awaited was hell.</p>
<p>so i go inside and i don&#8217;t see anyone i know. except for Susan and Mike, who passed by on their way in. i couldn&#8217;t tell if they were ignoring me or if they didn&#8217;t recognize me. that was sort of a theme of the evening. they have every reason to ignore me. when i was younger and stupider, i did stupid things and said foolish things to Susan, who i loved then, about Mike, who was actually a terrific guy, really. so there&#8217;s that.</p>
<p>i&#8217;m in line for about a half an hour, behind a small group of people who obviously bothered to keep up with him in his last years. suddenly i realize that the older gentleman standing idly by is Jason&#8217;s dad.</p>
<p>omg. it&#8217;s his dad, i thought. omg. is it better that he does or doesn&#8217;t recognize me?</p>
<p>see, we used to be really crazy teenagers. really crazy, just completely off the chain and full of joy and insanity. we used to bounce off the walls with energy. we also used to do some questionable stuff. nothing terrible, just not real virtuous behavior. all in good fun, we figured at the time. and it was.</p>
<p>but we got suspended from school once, toward the very ass-end of my senior year, which would have been Jason&#8217;s sophomore year, for showing up drunk at a school dance, with liquor and beer in my car to boot. crap. i got him in trouble. i hope they don&#8217;t remember that.</p>
<p>he looks at me and we chat, and he doesn&#8217;t seem to really remember me well. that&#8217;s kind of a big relief.</p>
<p>then the question i was dreading.</p>
<p>no, i said, even though i only live a half hour away, i didn&#8217;t really bother to go and see him, as he&#8217;s dying, because i just didn&#8217;t. because i don&#8217;t fucking know, right? i didn&#8217;t say it like that, but i certainly meant it like that.</p>
<p>i tried several times to gather a posse together. too many years had passed. i needed a buffer to fill up the empty space of time that had grown like kudzu between us. he and i talked on the phone a few years ago, and the net result of the conversation was, i felt at the time, that he was grown up and doing his thing, and though we were greatly cordial, there was a fairly vast chasm that had come up there in the middle. we weren&#8217;t those kids anymore. he didn&#8217;t need me in his life. we of course said &#8220;we should get together sometime,&#8221; and &#8220;give me a call anytime,&#8221; and neither of us really meant it. though i would have secretly loved to. but you know how it goes. it&#8217;s happened to everyone. two old friends, grown apart after too much time.</p>
<p>i loved him, though, and i never stopped loving him. it had just become awkward. that&#8217;s why i wanted help, someone to go with me to see him.</p>
<p>so i answered that question. no, i didn&#8217;t go to see your dying son in his last couple of years in life. fuck! i wanted to. desperately. i was too scared of that god damned void that had opened up its gaping maw between us to suck our friendship in. i pussied out.</p>
<p>finally, i see him up close.</p>
<p>no mortician on earth really ever makes a dead body look natural. not to me anyway. it&#8217;s always a horrific shock to see something that resembles someone you used to know very well lying before you like some kind of expired doppelganger. it was just too unreal. i knew it was him, he just didn&#8217;t look&#8230; real. that always happens.</p>
<p>the shock, the numbness of it all was overwhelming.</p>
<p>i go outside, roll a couple more smokes, pretend like i&#8217;m talking on my phone. anything to keep the questions at bay. thankfully, Travis shows up with his mom. i keep quiet and let them do all the talking. conversations get better that way.</p>
<p>Fred texts me that he can&#8217;t show up because he supposedly doesn&#8217;t have enough gas. me and Jason were pretty tight back in the day, but Fred and Jason were like peanut butter and jelly. completely inseperable. i am disappointed.</p>
<p>Kevin Holsinger shows up in a little while. the other day i practically cried at the thought of seeing that kooky lil&#8217; kid again. we were never all that close, but i always liked him. you couldn&#8217;t not. and we always had terrific laughs together. he doesn&#8217;t seem to know who i am, and since it doesn&#8217;t really matter anyway, i let the matter be as it is.</p>
<p>later on, Travis and his mom and Kevin and his whole family go out to eat. i didn&#8217;t go, it was just too awkward for me. i had a bad day. plus, i needed to pick Holly up from a business meeting. it turned out she got a ride, a fact i knew at right about the same instant as everyone was driving away. not that it would have made a difference.</p>
<p>there was not one single moment of the day that i had any business being a part of. but i owe like hell.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s hard when it really sinks in how much you never really mattered in the end, when someone you loved so much and had so much fun with is dead and gone so many years after you last saw them.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Finally, the United States of America has confidantly voted into office its first black President, and today is the first day of the Future after all. I am so proud again to be an American.</p>
<p>We owe a tremendous debt to black, female, latino, and other &#8220;minority&#8221; voters, many of whom have until today been disenfranchised - not just for <a href="http://www.thenation.com/blogs/campaignmatters/380366" class="liexternal">what they have done today</a>, but for what they have done in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Labor" class="liwikipedia">past</a> to bring us to this moment.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but recall the more joyful lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman" class="liwikipedia">Walt Whitman</a>&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/figures/brn.00001.001_large.jpg" class="liexternal">loving ballad</a> to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" class="liwikipedia">his President</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>O Captain my Captain! our fearful trip is done;<br />
The ship has weather’d every rack, the prize we sought is won;<br />
The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,<br />
While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring</p>
<p>O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;<br />
Rise up—for you the flag is flung—for you the bugle trills;<br />
For you bouquets and ribbon’d wreaths—for you the shores a-crowding;<br />
For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;</p>
<p>The ship is anchor’d safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;<br />
From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Of course, i have omitted stanzas which are not needed and do not serve this day; the poem, after all, is an elegy.)</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We voted today.</p>
<ul>
<li>Poll workers didn&#8217;t know what they were doing. One lady was on the phone with the Board of Elections the entire time, asking a new question for virtually every single voter. They could not locate the provisional ballots initially.</li>
<li>Holly, who registered and until today showed up on the local Board of Elections web site, had to vote via provisional ballot. I did not. She and i both independently witnessed two other couples having the same problem. The poll worker said that it had been happening. But also insisted that Holly wasn&#8217;t registered, and that the web site had provided incorrect information. How the web site would even have her name is beyond me.</li>
<li>We had zero privacy. There were no boundaries, and i filled out my ballot within inches of people standing in line who could all see every choice i made very clearly. Thankfully, did not get lynched afterward for voting strongly anti-American.</li>
<li>Also, there were only two tables set up for filling out ballots, and two chairs for each. Holy fuck that is not going to get people in and out, or entice people to wait when it takes hours and hours to get to that miserable but glorious point.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, do not let these things stand in your way! If you have problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact your local Board of Elections,</li>
<li>Contact your local and/or national party HQ,</li>
<li>Contact 1.866.OUR.VOTE, and</li>
<li>Make your local media aware of the situation</li>
</ul>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The house next door to us is abandoned and boarded up. It didn&#8217;t used to be. There used to be some middle-aged lady living there. She was an addict of some sort. There was often craziness over there, including one priceless <a href="http://www.trailerparkboys.com/" class="liexternal">Trailer Park Boys</a> moment which i will leave for another time.</p>
<p>Then she moved out.</p>
<p>Squatters moved in. And out.</p>
<p>The place was boarded up, the brush and foliage have overgrown, and the place is a headache for all of us over here.</p>
<p>Today, there is a dead thing in the back yard. It looks like a dog from where i can see it.</p>
<p>First, i called Dead Animal Removal. They directed me to Animal Control, as it&#8217;s not public property and they don&#8217;t have jurisdiction to just wander onto the property and remove random dead things. Animal Control directed me to the police department - i guess the call was transferred to the county Sherriff&#8217;s office, because they advised me to contact city police, who advised that i should definitely contact Housing&#8230; who suggested that maybe someone (as in one of us neighbors) could just get a bag and a shovel and get it over with. I persuaded her to connect me with the inspector for that address, and left a rather terse message on his voicemail that someone needs to do something about this problem property and that either he needs to contact the owner or let me know how i can do so myself.</p>
<p>Square one.</p>
<p>So i contacted the Mayor&#8217;s office. I can&#8217;t remember the lady&#8217;s name, but she was wonderful and took the information down to pass along to whoever it is that needs to know these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Then i got antsy. I looked up the property info on the county&#8217;s web site (see <a href="http://www.mctreas.org/master.cfm?parid=R72%2004407%200002&amp;taxyr=2008&amp;own1=FREIDENBERGER%20TIMOTHY%20TR" class="liexternal">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mcrealestate.org/Forms/Datalets.aspx?mode=PROFILEALL&amp;taxyear=2008&amp;ownseq=1&amp;roll=RP_OH&amp;jur=000&amp;sIndex=0&amp;idx=1&amp;pin=&amp;card=1&amp;item=1&amp;State=1&amp;items=-1" class="liexternal">here</a>). A simple search on the name and address gave some interesting info, including the fact that the address is the same as that of <a href="http://parklandgroup.homestead.com/Contact.html" class="liexternal">a previous owner</a>. Oddly enough, that same address in Dublin, Ohio also was the address of a defunct <acronym title="Unidentified Flying Object">UFO</acronym> organization called MORA.</p>
<p>So to you, mister Timothy Freidenberger TR (or mister Kurt Novak, whoever owns the goddamn place), i say this:</p>
<p>Come and get your fucking house under control, sir! I would burn the god damned thing down myself but your overgrown branches would no doubt catch our own place of residence, with ourselves inside, aflame to boot, not to mention the nasty legal ramifications of such an terrible but no doubt really goddamn enjoyable act.</p>
<p>UPDATE1: Mister Novak returned my call. I advised him that the property is a nuisance. He shifted blame to the city, which certainly bears some of the burden of responsibility. I advised that the owner is also a source of the problem, as there is brush and trees so overgrown that the bums who appropriated our television panel had no problem hiding in them. He seemed to be under the impression that someone he pays actually comes out to take care of the place. I further advised that it would probably be best to just raze the goddamn thing down and sell the land. He didn&#8217;t see that as an option, and the call ended on a note of pretend cordiality not long afterward.</p>
<p>UPDATE2: Someone actually came out, i know not from whence, and removed the dead thing.</p>
