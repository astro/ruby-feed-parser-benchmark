			<title>What the Ad? - Portability, 1980's Style</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;If early 1980's marketing is to be believed, then the guy hauling around dead trees in a faux leather case is doing it completely wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a target="_blank" href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/osborne1-full.png"&gt;&lt;img height="678" width="490" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/osborne1.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the pioneering Osborne 1 didn't thrive for very long due in part to two large flaws. One being the diminutive 5&amp;quot; (10 cm) screen and the fact that it weighed in at a hefty 23.5 pounds (10.7kg). To put this into perspective, the weight of a single Osborne 1 is equivalent to 122 hot dogs (buns + ketchup included)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height="174" width="550" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/hotdog_vs_osborne.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Need something smaller than the Takeru Kobayashi Special? Why not opt for Radio Shack's TRS-80 Pocket Computer instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/TRS-80-full.png"&gt;&lt;img height="596" width="420" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/TRS-80.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only slightly longer than a checkbook and weighing in at only 6oz (170g) it seems like a dream come true when compared to the Osborne 1. It is, if your dream is to have a 24x1 character display and you're ok being limited to programs written in BASIC (ok assembler too, but what kind of sadomasochist would program assembly on this thing, seriously!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aw heck, if a single line of text is all you need, why not release your inner-geek and go with the Pocket ASCII Terminal with its &amp;quot;Man-Sized&amp;quot; capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/pocket_ascii.jpg"&gt;&lt;img height="538" width="400" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/pocket_ascii.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Java Takes Down the Network</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wtf_imgfloatright" style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt="Photo credit: 'Csaba_Bajko' at Flickr" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/140428053_872a674232_m.jpg" /&gt; &amp;quot;Alright! 11:02 a.m...Another five bucks for me!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again, &lt;b&gt;Ricky Fine&lt;/b&gt; had hit it big in the network technician over/under betting pool for predicting the time of the daily network outage. It occurred around 11am, every day, but not precisely. The network would pulse on and off around 60 cycles per minute, but again, not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Any results from the packet sniffer?&amp;quot; asked another technician.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Nothing, not even so much as a stutter,&amp;quot; replied Ricky, &amp;quot;You'd think for as much money as this thing costs, we'd get a hint as to what's going on.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technician sighed, &amp;quot;Well, we'll just try again tomorrow. What do you say? Next one's going to be before 11 a.m.?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Definitely. We're due for an 'under' this time around,&amp;quot; agreed Ricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Days passed and with their tools failing them, Ricky and his fellow technicians finally had to resort to brute strength analysis. This meant disconnecting different network segments every day and was by no means an easy task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;The Hardware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;The thing about the hardware that Ricky and his co-workers supported was that it came from an era before CAT5 and fiber optics. Their ethernet was a swarm of coax cabling and BNC connectors, usually run haphazardly through buildings that were never designed for it. Also, as if to add insult to injury, the company exclusively used hubs for their internal network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a good reason why hubs have since been relegated as relics: unlike switches, which intelligently route packets to the appropriate destination, hubs simply repeat all packets from all connected devices to all of the other connected devices. This, along with wiring factors made the outage develop into a riddle, wrapped up in an enigma, encased within a rats&amp;rsquo; nest of cabling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Brute Force Pays Off&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;Finally, one day, they located the problem segment as the network was going down - the fifth floor. They checked every bit of cable on the line, working through the night testing impendence, frays, an even going so far as to swap out every network card on all of the PCs on the floor. Having done everything in their power, Ricky and his crew felt confident that the problem was solved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No such luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next day, 11 a.m. rolled around and a couple of minutes later, there was the regular outage. Like a pack of bloodhounds, the technicians fanned out to every cable run connected to the floor's hub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricky was under a cubicle desk looking for the cable run when he heard, &amp;quot;Thump, thump, thump...&amp;quot; coming from the other side of the cubicle wall. It was about every second, but not exactly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When he emerged and peeked around the corner, he was met with the department's resident coffee expert. He could extol the virtues or curses of every kind of coffee made and every roaster in the area. And as it happened, he had just returned from percolating his morning dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carefully observing the coffee connoisseur, Ricky watched him take a large sip of coffee, set his foot on the BNC connector, and nervously roll it back and forth a few times. A few second later, he'd take another sip and tap the connector again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn't take too long for Ricky to realize that, every day, he'd get hopped up on java, direct his nervousness at his work and absently roll the BNC connector like others would drum their fingers. The outage would provide enough of a break that he'd calm down a bit and leave that innocent connector alone for the rest of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricky went ahead and moved the BNC connector out of the line of fire and the next day, no problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;The Aftermath&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;After the smoke cleared and business got back to normal, the final cost of the outage was calculated, and the executives were furious. From the rented network sniffer to the hours of productivity and data lost during the outage, someone was going to have to answer how they could be so naive as to not be able to find that the problem was caused by the nervous gyrations of the local caffeine junkie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ricky's group did their best to emphasize that their infrastructure was at fault rather than the competence of the technicians. The execs scoffed at their explanation but, when the cost of new cable runs and upgraded network equipment was compared to the cost of the outage, they relented and agreed to upgrade the infrastructure. After all, there were a lot of coffee drinkers in the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6382"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6382&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was perusing the legal section of the The Beach Reporter and came across some missing 'links',&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Ben Siepser&lt;/b&gt; wrote, &amp;quot;good thing ordinance legalese is completely unreadable anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;This error came from a crash in Rise of Nations,&amp;quot; writes &lt;b&gt;Matt W&lt;/b&gt;, &amp;quot;I should've pressed 'Retry' or 'Ignore&amp;quot; to see what it would have done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Bringing Up Baby</title> 
			<link>http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Bringing-Up-Baby.aspx</link> 
			<category>Feature Articles</category>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/bringingUpBaby.jpg" /&gt;Ray's life was out of control, but not in a bad way &amp;ndash; it was just that everything was happening all at the same time. His wife was in her eighth month of pregnancy, so they were back and forth at Lamaze classes, babyproofing, and converting the spare bedroom into a nursery. Not to mention that Ray had received a better job offer and accepted, meaning that he had two weeks of transition at his old job and would have to hit the ground running as an admin at the new place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Ray nor his wife had a spare second to just sit down and catch their breath, which made their anticipation for their upcoming trip even greater. The idea was to drive from the south to the north and back again, showing off their baby to friends and family. It wouldn't have been a problem since Ray had accrued over two weeks of vacation time at his previous employer. His new employer, however, wasn't terribly understanding of the request when it came up. Ray begged and pleaded, and eventually worked out a compromise &amp;ndash; he could take his trip as long as it started after he'd been there for a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things started as smoothly as they would at any job. The work was reasonably interesting, and the coworkers seemed reasonably normal. That is, until Ray had to work on a Saturday. Being at the office on a weekend is always a little bit surreal &amp;ndash; hardly anyone's there, most of the lights are off, and it's eerily quiet. The dress code is decidedly more lax over the weekend when there are no clients to impress, and this is something that Ray's boss, Spencer, took &lt;em&gt;full advantage&lt;/em&gt; of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;The Goggles!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;When Ray came in that day, he had to stop by Spencer's office for a quick question. Spencer spun around in his chair, revealing his outfit &amp;ndash; a tight sleeveless undershirt that was too short to fully cover his sizable, hairy stomach, beneath which sat the shortest Richard Simmons-style shorts Ray had ever seen. The gruesome sight made Ray immediately forget the question he was going to ask, in addition to permanently etching the scene into his memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason Ray was there on a Saturday was that one of the servers had gone down. The issue sounded like it was a dead power supply this time, but it could have been any number of things &amp;ndash; there was no redundancy for the drives, no reasonable cooling system, and, well, no reasonable equipment, really. The &amp;quot;servers&amp;quot; were all repurposed home desktop systems purchased from Costco &amp;ndash; many of which still had the stickers on the case advertising a handful of free MP3 downloads and free ISP trials. For whatever reason, though, they didn't come preinstalled with SQL Server, IIS, or directory management tools. Ray was able to salvage a power supply from an old, unused workstation, and he made a mental note to stop by Costco next time he was in the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was while working on this task that Ray learned the corridor usage policy. The reception area was near the area with the rest of the staff, and down the hall were the executives' offices. Employees could &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; use the hallway if they were meeting with executives. If you were in a room that had two or three doors and you didn't choose the door closest to the office you were going to, you'd be forced to reenter the room and leave from the closest door. In fact, if there was a closer door in the &lt;em&gt;building&lt;/em&gt;, sometimes the employees would literally have to leave the building and walk outside for a bit to get to the closest door. The first time Spencer corrected him for choosing the wrong door and told him to leave from another door, Ray continued on his way, thinking he was kidding; but he wasn't &amp;ndash; in fact, Spencer was completely aghast at Ray's blatant insubordination. That was the day that Ray's boss began to dislike him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Baby Time&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;After a few weeks on the job, it was finally time &amp;ndash; Ray's wife was in labor! Ray frantically started calling friends and family, and made sure to call the office to let them know he was going with his wife to the hospital. The time from leaving the house to his standing by his wife's side in the delivery room was a blur. While Ray was in the delivery room, his heart beating out of his chest, his cell phone rang. &lt;em&gt;Probably one of his wife's family members that were in town to help with the baby&lt;/em&gt;, he thought. Without letting go of his wife's hand, he answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ray.&amp;quot; It was the office. &amp;quot;The mail server is down, are you all wrapped up there?&amp;quot; Spencer spoke in a tone usually reserved for asking if you'd like fries with your order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray was usually pretty laid back, but this was ridiculous. &amp;quot;I'm &lt;em&gt;in the delivery room! My wife is in labor!&lt;/em&gt; Don't call me on this line today unless it's &lt;em&gt;literally&lt;/em&gt; a life-or-death emergency!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; an emergency, we have no email! When will you be done?&amp;quot; Apparently he and Ray were operating on different understandings of what &amp;quot;literally&amp;quot; means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Look, you can try rebooting, but I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; can't talk now.&amp;quot; *click*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many intense hours passed with Ray's wife having frequent contractions, but the baby wasn't coming. She and Ray were getting more and more worried with each passing hour, until finally at around 2:00 AM, the doctor advised an emergency C-section. This didn't ease their anxiety much, but they agreed that it would be best. And at over 16 hours after arriving at the hospital, Ray and his wife finally had a healthy baby boy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray's body was telling him he needed to rest, but sleep refused to come &amp;ndash; he was still coming down from the whole ordeal. Several hours later on that same morning, Ray's phone rang again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You're coming in, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray buried his face in his hands and sighed deeply. He couldn't bring himself to respond. Spencer went on to explain that the mail server was still down, that Ray was really on thin ice &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; after showing disregard to the corridor policy, and expected to see him at 8:00. &amp;quot;Oh, and stop by Costco on the way.&amp;quot; And despite all Ray had been through and the lack of sleep, he figured he could break away, fix the mail server, and be back in an hour or two. Ray went in to the office, fixed the server, and wound up working a full eight hour shift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two months later, Ray and his wife left on their trip. As they slowly worked their way north they were having a great time and everyone loved the baby; not just their loved ones, but basically everyone that crossed their paths. Only one thing slightly diminished their joy &amp;ndash; about halfway through the trip Ray noticed that his bank account wasn't showing any new deposits. He cursed himself for not ironing out whether it was a paid vacation or not with his employer; it had just slipped his mind during the interview. &lt;i&gt;Oh well&lt;/i&gt;, he thought, &lt;i&gt;my mistake. I'll just have to check with them when I get back.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As their whirlwind trip came to a close, Ray returned to work as normal for two days just to make sure that no one had broken anything while he was out. When he'd fully settled in again, he stopped by Spencer's desk. That is, after leaving the building, walking around to another entrance, and taking the shortest path to his office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Welcome Home&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&amp;quot;Hi, Spencer. I just wanted to double check with you about my vacation. I know we didn't iron out the specifics ahead of time, I just wanted to know whether it was supposed to be paid or unpaid time off.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spencer's eyes widened. &amp;quot;I can't believe you're coming in here asking for more money! I let you have time off when you had your baby! I &lt;i&gt;could&lt;/i&gt; have made you come in anyway!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray's jaw dropped. The only thing keeping him from lashing out at Spencer was that his brain was busy trying to forget the memory of him in his &amp;quot;Saturday&amp;quot; outfit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ray quit on the spot, after which Spencer threw his hands in the air in frustration, calling Ray a &amp;quot;money grubbing kid.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Ray didn't have to look far for a new job, since his previous employer was looking for a systems administrator and was happy to hire him back with a higher salary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other company had a harder time finding a replacement, however. Ray belonged to a local tech workers' mailing list, in which a job ad had been placed by Spencer. For whatever reason, Spencer had thought it prudent to include a complaint about Ray, specifically &amp;quot;The previous guy took lots of time off and left without notice.&amp;quot; No mention of the Costco PCs or the corridor policy, though.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6388"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6388&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>Waiting to Excel </title> 
			<link>http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Waiting-to-Excel-.aspx</link> 
			<category>Feature Articles</category>
			<pubDate>Tue, 09 Dec 2008 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate> 
			<guid isPermaLink="false">6386</guid> 
			<description>&lt;p&gt;It was Seth's first day on the job. He had just completed the usual paperwork and orientation stuff, when his new boss Gabe said: &amp;quot;Why don't you take care of Issue #88743?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth loaded up their issue tracker and eagerly navigated to #88743. The ticket read as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
NETWORK OPS BUILT A NEW EMAIL SERVER FOR DEVELOPMENT. 
PLEASE UPDATE THE TEST VERSION'S CONFIG FILE TO 
USE 10.1.8.22 AS THE SMTP SERVER. &lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly, the purpose of the assignment was to get Seth acquainted with the codebase. The application he was hired to maintain was used to manage commercial real estate properties, and was sold to management companies of all sizes. And because it was built in .NET, Seth figured he'd start by hunting for the app.config file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;The Spreadsheet Begins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;When Seth opened up the codebase's root folder, a file named config.xls immediately caught his attention. The file had several different Excel worksheets, each named for a different module in the application. The worksheets each contained two columns -- KEY and VALUE -- and each had a handful of rows. The key he needed to change -- &amp;quot;SMTP Server&amp;quot; -- was staring right at him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Just type in the new IP address and hit save,&amp;quot; Gabe said with a big grin on his face. &amp;quot;Pretty elegant, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seth wasn't quite sure how to respond to all this, so he just smiled and figured he'd make the small configuration change. When he saved config.xls, though, a custom dialog box popped up: &amp;quot;WARNING: About to Save Changes to Configuration! Are you sure everything is OK?&amp;quot; Heeding the warning, he clicked &amp;quot;Cancel&amp;quot; and verified that he had, in fact, typed in 10.1.8.22 correctly. Curious as to why that message had appeared, Seth hit ALT-F11 to bring up the VBA Macro Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What came up was 1,000-plus lines of Excel VBA code that seemed to validate and tidy up the variety of different configuration fields. There was even a macro named &amp;quot;Upgrade()&amp;quot; that, apparently, was responsible for loading the values out of an older version of the configuration spreadsheet into the current file. The first line of code in that macro rendered the entire macro moot as it just popped up a dialog box that said &amp;quot;Not Supported Anymore.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the application side of things, the VB.NET configuration code wasn't any prettier. There were three distinct ways to read values from the configuration file, but only two seemed to work. The &amp;quot;COM Interop&amp;quot; method was great if you wanted to find a value in a specific cell (such as sheet 5, column 2, row 23), while the ADO.NET method was used to find a value by name (such as &amp;quot;SMTP Server&amp;quot;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Problem Update&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;Seth wasn't alone in thinking there were much better solutions. None of the developers, however, could convince Gabe. Until that one day, when a customer needed to update the mailing address that the application used and followed the instructions provided by tech support: open config.xls, navigate to the &amp;quot;Company&amp;quot; workbook, and edit the appropriate address fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was an experienced Excel user and had no problem updating the data. By force of habit, she made sure to type in the apostrophe (') character before entering their new ZIP code so that Excel would recognize it as text instead of a number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And therein lay the problem: the field was already defined as text and their data-validation routine never took into consideration the ZIP code apostrophe and allowed the file to save as normal. A perfect storm of bugs allowed the apostrophe'd ZIP code to be used in a SQL statement, which ended up wreaking quite a bit of havoc on their data. And thanks to their &amp;quot;gotta-catch-'em-all&amp;quot; error-handling philosophy, it took nearly 12 hours to figure all this out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;After Word&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&amp;quot;This is completely unacceptable,&amp;quot; Gabe yelled in the developer meeting. &amp;quot;Can't you guys write a simple Excel macro!? Or at least test for stuff like this?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well,&amp;quot; one of the developers defended, &amp;quot;we did, but the customer never updated their macro code. This is probably why no one uses Excel for configuration files.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Huh?&amp;quot; Gabe frowned, &amp;quot;Excel is a proven technology! Besides, easy-to-edit is a priority, people!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another developer sarcastically remarked, &amp;quot;Then why not just use Microsoft Word?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At that moment, Gabe's expression went from angry to intrigued. &amp;quot;Actually, we could do that! No apostrophes to worry about and it's even easier to use,&amp;quot; he said as his mind started to wander toward the technical implementation. &amp;quot;It'd be pretty elegant, eh?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Waiting to Excel  was originally published in Alex's DevDisasters column in the Oct 1, 2008 issue of &lt;a href="http://reddevnews.com/"&gt;Redmond Developer News&lt;/a&gt;. RDN is a &lt;a href="http://reddevnews.com/subscribe/"&gt;free&lt;/a&gt; magazine for influential readers and provides insight into Microsoft's plans, and news on the latest happenings and products in the Windows development marketplace. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6386"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6386&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;In today's fast-paced world of cell phones, Sega Nomads, and turn signals, we don't have time for &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;. That's why we have acronyms. Just try to read until the end of this: International Business Machines Corporation. Congratulations if you're still awake &amp;ndash; the rest of us non-MENSA types will keep referring to it as IBM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;b&gt;Chris N.&lt;/b&gt;'s employer, they needed the ability to look up acronyms' meanings, so one of Chris's predecessors got cracking on a solution. Not one to buy into that whole normalization thing, he created a table like the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ROWID&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_CDE&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_TXT&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;867&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;INTERNATIONAL&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;868&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;BUSINESS&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;869&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;MACHINES&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;870&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;CORPORATION&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then he came up against a wall. What about acronyms that can mean several things? Take &amp;quot;LA.&amp;quot; Is it Los Angeles, Louisiana, or Louis Armstrong? Not to fear, the addition of an ABBR_IDX column made things all better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ROWID&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_CDE&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_TXT&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_IDX&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1121&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LA&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LOS&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1122&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LA&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;ANGELES&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1123&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LA&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1124&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LA&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;LOUISIANA&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might be asking yourself &amp;quot;does LA really represent thirty Xs in their system?&amp;quot; The answer is short answer is &amp;quot;no;&amp;quot; the long answer is &amp;quot;no, and I can't believe you counted all of the Xs.&amp;quot; For whatever reason, that sequence was chosen as a delimiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
protected final String ACRONYM_PHRASE_DELIMITER = &amp;quot;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&amp;quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, that's the only reference to ACRONYM_PHRASE_DELIMITER in the entire codebase. Instead, the convenience of the following method is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
private static boolean isNotAllXs( String s )
{
    StringBuffer test = new StringBuffer( s.trim() );
    boolean retVal = false;
    for ( int i = 0; i &amp;lt; test.length(); i++ )
    {
        if ( test.charAt( i ) != 'X' )
        {
            retVal = true;
        }
    }
    return retVal;
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the system could handle multiple defnitions per acronym, Chris's predecessor (or maybe someone else) went back through and updated a bunch of the old acronyms. For instance, &amp;quot;IBM&amp;quot; could now mean:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ROWID&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_CDE&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_TXT&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_IDX&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1181&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;INTERNATIONAL&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1182&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;MACHINES&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1183&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;IBM&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;BUSINESS&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, that's how it was entered. And here's another example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ROWID&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_CDE&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_TXT&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_IDX&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;7712&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WCAB&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WORK&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;7713&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WCAB&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;COMPENSATION&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;7714&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WCAB&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;APPEAL&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;

            &lt;td&gt;WCAB&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/td&gt;

            &lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chris wrote a handy data access object that communicates with the table and made a friendly hashmap for people to use., so things are at least a little better than they used to be (as this system has been in use for years now).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, just one acronym comes to mind, but in the spirit of solidarity, here it is in table form:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="3" border="1"&gt;
    &lt;thead&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ROWID&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_CDE&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_TXT&lt;/th&gt;
            &lt;th&gt;ABBR_IDX&lt;/th&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;/thead&gt;
    &lt;tbody&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;8411&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WTF&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WHAT&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;8412&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WTF&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;THE&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;tr&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;8414&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;WTF&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX&lt;/td&gt;
            &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wtf_imgfloatright" style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/thawtf.png" /&gt;Not too long ago, &lt;strong&gt;Eric J.&lt;/strong&gt; signed up for Thawte&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="http://www.thawte.com/secure-email/personal-email-certificates/index.html"&gt;Personal E-mail Certificates&lt;/a&gt; service. While reviewing the various account settings, he noticed something odd. One of his &amp;ldquo;Lost Password&amp;rdquo; security questions read &lt;em&gt;What was your alarm code to the Lindsay Bar in Trinity 1999?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing that Eric didn&amp;rsquo;t have a house alarm in 1999 and, in fact, didn&amp;rsquo;t even know where Trinity was (let alone the Lindsay Bar), Eric was pretty sure that it was some kind of mix-up. He changed the security question back to &lt;em&gt;What was your alarm code?&lt;/em&gt; and hit submit. No dice. When the page reloaded, it added the Lindsay Bar right back in the question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bit concerned at that point, Eric tried another question: &lt;em&gt;What was your first cat&amp;rsquo;s name?&lt;/em&gt; Upon submitting the page, Thawte decided that he would rather have the question be &lt;em&gt;What was your first cat&amp;rsquo;s name (uppercase)&lt;/em&gt;, despite the fact that he had typed &amp;ldquo;fur ball&amp;rdquo; in lowercase. And it also insisted that the question have a space between the word &amp;ldquo;cat&amp;rdquo; and the question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It didn&amp;rsquo;t take Eric too long to realize what was happening. For some bizarre reason, Thawte was completing his questions by using other user&amp;rsquo;s questions. When he typed in simply &lt;em&gt;What was&lt;/em&gt;, it shot back &lt;em&gt;What was Seti 1 &lt;/em&gt;. Typing in &lt;em&gt;What did&lt;/em&gt; returned &lt;em&gt;What did I find on Romsley hill?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Eric shared this with me, I signed up for a personal e-mail certificate at Thawte. Within a few minutes, I not only had my my very own certificate, but limited access to all the fun questions that other people use. Here are a few interesting security questions that Eric and I were able to dig up (with the &amp;ldquo;search&amp;rdquo; question &lt;em&gt;emphasized&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Personal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What did i do&lt;/em&gt; 25/08/2005 10h AM ?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;what did you do to&lt;/em&gt; herman?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where do I hide&lt;/em&gt; my conscience?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this the&lt;/em&gt; best I can be?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Will I ever&lt;/em&gt; be fat?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How did I&lt;/em&gt; break a rib?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where did &lt;/em&gt;you find the holsters?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Very Personal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who did &lt;/em&gt;you first sleep with?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who did you have&lt;/em&gt; a baby with?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who did you have sex&lt;/em&gt; with at VIPP(1st &amp;amp; last name)?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does my wife&lt;/em&gt; have a pierced navel?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Does your wife&lt;/em&gt; have a big butt?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;did I ever&lt;/em&gt; had sex?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you love&lt;/em&gt; Allan?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Questions we all want answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the&lt;/em&gt; airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do&lt;/em&gt; baby wood ducks get down?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;why are&lt;/em&gt; chickens happy?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Why was the&lt;/em&gt; 4th element introduced?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where did it&lt;/em&gt; all began?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is this a&lt;/em&gt; dream?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who know reading other people&amp;rsquo;s secret questions could be such fun? Thankfully, this doesn&amp;rsquo;t work on the answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for why Thawte chose to implement shared questions in this manner... I&amp;rsquo;ll leave that as an exercise in speculation for the reader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6389"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6389&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;With more than 1 million dollars spent in R&amp;amp;D, Brandon's software company wasn't keen on paying an outside firm to develop its new product's site. The product manager, however, was adamant that the company outsource.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The last thing we want to do is risk our huge investment,&amp;quot; the product manager reasoned. &amp;quot;Not only could our developers overcomplicate things, but they could very well neglect key features such as search engine optimization and usability, either of which would be disastrous to a successful product launch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the developers certainly excelled at building complex Web-based applications, a simple HTML-only Web site wasn't quite their forte. The software company hired an interactive marketing firm to build a new site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Blank Pages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;After a few months, the marketing firm delivered the new site. All told, it looked pretty good: The site shared the look and feel of the company's existing Web site, but with its own unique color and layout. In addition, the copy that marketing developed was nicely presented around screenshots of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon decided to peek behind the scenes to see how the marketing company put the page together. When he viewed the page's source code, he was surprised to see a mere 128 bytes of HTML.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;html&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;quot;code.js&amp;quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/head&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;body onLoad=&amp;quot;assemblePage();&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/html&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Curious as to the kind of JavaScript voodoo that's required to build a full-fledged Web page out of a single method call, Brandon opened up code.js. What he discovered was a strange, custom-built templating system that relied entirely on client-side JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The assemblePage() function ran when the page loaded used XmlHttpRequest (or AJAX) to get a file called header.html, which was then inserted into the page dynamically. Then the process continued with leftsidenav.html, rightsidenav.html, middle.html and footer.html. Actual content was loaded the same way, after inspecting the request URL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What this all meant for users without JavaScript enabled-including many search engine spiders, such as the GoogleBot-was a big blank page. Against his better judgment, Brandon continued to dive further in the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly proud of their JavaScript skills, the marketing firm's developers took another interesting approach to implementing the &amp;quot;contact us&amp;quot; form. Rather than submitting the HTML-based form through a POST to some form-mailer script, the &amp;quot;Submit&amp;quot; button triggered a JavaScript function called buildSqlStmt().&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In horror, Brandon watched the function parse the HTML form and build a SQL INSERT statement. It would then use AJAX to send the SQL statement directly to the server. Hoping the developers had some sense to restrict database permissions, parse the statement or at the very least ensure that it didn't contain words such as &amp;quot;DROP,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;DELETE,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;UPDATE,&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;ALTER,&amp;quot; Brian looked at the server side handler: execSqlStatement.ashx. And, of course, the handler offered no protection. It blindly executed the SQL statement against the database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Marketing Matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;Brandon brought these concerns to the product manager, who wasn't at all pleased that a developer was sticking his nose into &amp;quot;marketing matters.&amp;quot; After several requests, the product manager finally agreed to schedule a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I'm curious,&amp;quot; Brandon said. &amp;quot;Does our new Web site support Google indexing?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Absolutely,&amp;quot; the marketing firm's rep answered. &amp;quot;That search box on your site-we're actually using Google to do that, for free, all thanks to our search engine optimizations!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the rep spoke, the product manager glared at Brandon for asking such an asinine question. &amp;quot;Thanks,&amp;quot; Brandon responded, feigning sincerity. &amp;quot;I was wondering because, when I visited the page with NoScript, it was just blank. I figured that if I couldn't see it, the GoogleBot couldn't either.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh,&amp;quot; the rep said, clearly disconcerted. &amp;quot;Well, uhh ... Hold on a sec.&amp;quot; A minute later, the rep returned, adding: &amp;quot;Our developer just advised that we should probably remove the search box on the site.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OK,&amp;quot; Brandon replied. &amp;quot;Another concern I had was SQL injection. On the contact us page, if you ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Wait a second,&amp;quot; interrupted the rep. &amp;quot;Did you say SQL injection? You guys really don't have to worry about that. I mean, really, that's only a problem for the government and huge corporations.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, but it's not that hard to prevent ...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The marketing rep interrupted again: &amp;quot;You see, Brandon, we're employing a brand-new technology called AJAX that makes your pages load lightning-fast, form submissions quicker and be more responsive. It's a win-win for everyone.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brandon wasn't quite sure how to respond to that. The product manager saw that as the perfect opportunity to thank the marketing rep for addressing Brandon's concerns and ended the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, Brandon was able to sneak in a handful of fixes and patches to the Web site so that it could be indexed and not brought down by a SQL-injection attack. As for the marketing firm, the word was that it was already working on version 2 of the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Botched was originally published in Alex's DevDisasters column in the&amp;nbsp;Oct 15, 2008 issue of &lt;a href="http://reddevnews.com/"&gt;Redmond Developer News&lt;/a&gt;.

			<title>What the Ad? - Big Promises</title>

			<description>&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;I'm not saying that some advertising is prone to exaggeration, but sometimes, on occasion, the truth might be stretched at least a little bit.&amp;nbsp; Here are a few ads that I came across that I thought may be overstating their abilities just a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;If &amp;quot;THE LAST ONE&amp;quot; is to be believed, any idiot can now write completely bug-free programs in plain English. All for only $600? More proof that my college education was only worth the certificate of attendance that I got out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/All-programs-you-need-BIG.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Price is in $$, but company is in England.  I'll just wait for a good exchange rate." src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/All-programs-you-need-small.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;In my mind, I'm picturing the corner of the closet of some pennypinching office that still, to this day, has a 286 with a big sheet of paper that says &amp;quot;DON'T TOUCH OR YOU'LL BREAK THE NETWORK!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;a href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/Most-Powerful-LAN-BIG.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Check out dude's hand...Photoshop disaster?" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/Most-Powerful-LAN-small.png" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;Fastest compiler on Earth?&amp;nbsp; That's a pretty big claim!&amp;nbsp; One that I had to verify&amp;nbsp;personally.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(You can too &lt;a href="http://www.programmersheaven.com/download/3949/download.aspx"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, is&amp;nbsp;it&amp;nbsp;the fastest in the world?&amp;nbsp; Can't say for sure,&amp;nbsp;but it is pretty fast and&amp;nbsp;it even&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/ads/Mystic-In-Vista.png"&gt;works in Vista.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;Hold on a minute here...for a mere $75 in 1980's dollars, I could learn how to write practical and realistic programs, quickly and easily...in LISP!? I call fake. Only white beareded &lt;a href="http://itasoftware.com/"&gt;gurus&lt;/a&gt; on a mountain top can pass this knowledge...and the only kind of currency they work with&amp;nbsp;is souls.&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>A Hatchet Job</title>

			<category>Feature Articles</category>
			<pubDate>Wed, 03 Dec 2008 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate> 
			<guid isPermaLink="false">6384</guid> 
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200811/ahatchetjob.jpg" /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sebastian&lt;/b&gt; sat near a window, enjoying a hot dog in the warmth of the sun. The day was going wonderfully so far &amp;ndash; he was the first to get to the newspaper that was left in the break room daily (and usually gutted by noon), he'd found a quarter face up near his desk, and his hot dog was &lt;em&gt;particularly&lt;/em&gt; good since someone had left relish in the fridge with a note inviting anyone to help themselves. At first, he hardly noticed the hurried, heavy footsteps coming in behind him &amp;ndash; &amp;quot;My f&amp;ndash;cking VPN connection is broken again! Can't you stop fiddling with the god damn network‽&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Oh man... someone's getting it good!&lt;/i&gt; Sebastian sat motionless, afraid to turn around and catch some residual ire from whoever the CEO was yelling at. Chewing slowly, he kept eavesdropping. &amp;quot;Four weeks. Four f&amp;ndash;cking weeks my connection's been on again, off again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How soon can you fix it?&amp;quot; the CEO cried.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No answer. No nervous stammering, no &amp;quot;er, um...&amp;quot; Sebastian was feeling awkward listening, so he gathered his things and went to find a new location to finish his lunch. &amp;quot;Jesus! Are you even f&amp;ndash;cking listening‽&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Sebastian was almost out of the room, the CEO barked an even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; agitated &amp;quot;where the f&amp;ndash;ck are you going, Sebastian‽&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian's face changed to a bright shade of red that matched the CEO's, though for a different reason. &lt;i&gt;Crap&lt;/i&gt;, he thought, &lt;i&gt;he'd been talking to me the whole time!&lt;/i&gt; When he spun around, he saw that the break room was empty save for him and the CEO. &amp;quot;Er, um...&amp;quot; Sebastian stammered, &amp;quot;the who is what now?&amp;quot; An eloquent recovery for over thirty seconds of ignoring the CEO's yelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian was then treated to a chronicling of his incompetence, with his CEO as the narrator, after which he was left to do his work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian's first stop after finishing his hot dog was to check out their Netviewer system to remote into the CEO's home computer. Not only could he not remote in, he couldn't get &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; response. Surprising, because Sebastian had been the one to set up the hardware at his CEO's house in the first place. He'd even put the equipment in a locked box in the attic to prevent, say, the CEO from messing with it. It was off in a dusty corner of the attic where the power cords should've been safe from being accidentally unplugged. Despite his CEO's opinion, Sebastian was a very competent IT Tech, and had taken all of these things into consideration when setting it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Field Trip&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Looks like I'm driving out there&lt;/i&gt;, he thought. He stopped by his CEO's office, was treated to thirty more seconds of verbal abuse, given the keys, and sent on his way. 45 minutes later, he was at the front door. Supposedly no one would be home, but it would have been some wonderful icing on the cake if he'd witnessed some soap opera-esque drama unfolding between the CEO's wife and the pool boy while he was there. No such luck, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian plugged his laptop into the network in the CEO's study and got started.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Network cable present? &lt;i&gt;Check&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; still there.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Company router? &lt;i&gt;Check&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; working.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;DSL sync? &lt;i&gt;Nope&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; strange.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Internet access working? &lt;i&gt;Check&lt;/i&gt; &amp;ndash; WTF?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How can the internet access work when the DSL modem has no sync? And how can the VPN fail when the internet works? Sebastian traced all of the cables and studied everything, but had no success. When he tried to call the CEO from the house line, he couldn't even get a dial tone. Even Sebastian's cell phone couldn't get a signal, despite the signal being at full strength. &lt;i&gt;I'm going to die here, aren't I?&lt;/i&gt; he thought to himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feeling defeated, he took a moment to gaze out the window and think, when he noticed four big trucks down the street, sporting a massive collection of cables sticking out of the ground and what was apparently an adjoining cable distribution point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Great. I've been yelled at, accidentally ignored my boss, gotten yelled at some more, had my lunch cut short, driven forty five minutes, and all because the phone company broke something.&lt;/i&gt; Sebastian walked down the street, hoping for an ETA for when their work would be done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The repairman, clearly busy and annoyed at the interruption, said &amp;quot;someone broke into the store across the street last night. Went to town with an axe on this local telephone and DSL exchange to prevent the store's alarm signal from reaching out.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian's problem was solved. Or, rather, it would be, once the techs on the scene got everything sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, Sebastian was feeling troubled. &lt;i&gt;Am I going crazy?&lt;/i&gt; he pondered on the walk back to the CEO's house. He was &lt;em&gt;99% sure&lt;/em&gt; that he'd been able to reach the internet from his computer. In the CEO's study, he confirmed it again. Sebastian couldn't let this stand. He dug a little deeper, found the reason, and then spent a few minutes laughing like a crazy person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Mystery Solved&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;The CEO had ordered digital cable TV about four weeks prior. He had a tendency to not just opt for basic subscriptions for things, but the everything-plus-free-football-phone packages; in this case he got the cable TV &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; internet access, which included a router and other equipment. Not knowing what to do with it, he just shoved it all behind the TV, leaving it to be forgotten under the layers of cables from wall outlets, DVD players, speaker systems, and what have you. And since it had so many pretty brightly colored ports, he just plugged it into the network cable that Sebastian had left there just in case there would be a future installation. The router's DHCP server was active, and by chance, one of the two routers (either the one from the cable company or the one Sebastian had set up) would offer the computers upstairs an IP address on slightly different subnets. Don't you just love race conditions?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sebastian's hatred for strange coincidences is only outweighed by his hatred for people fiddling with his installations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6384"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6384&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;This code was sent to &lt;strong&gt;John W. &lt;/strong&gt;by the support staff of one of the larger software vendors with the stated purpose of determining how much memory a program could use on one of the corporation's Unix servers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;
#include &amp;lt;malloc.h&amp;gt;
 
int
 
main ()
{
float f;
char *p;
 
   while (1)
   {
      p = malloc(102400);
      if (!p)
         {
          printf (&amp;quot;malloc returned NULL\n&amp;quot;);
          exit(1);
         }
  
      f += 102400;
      printf (&amp;quot;%g\n&amp;quot;, f);
      printf (&amp;quot;%g %f %f MB\n&amp;quot;, f, f, f/1024000);
  
   }
}&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, fair readers, if you were to compile and run this code you your PC, as I did, you should see the WTF for yourself with no problems (spoiler: XP said I was running low on resources).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, John was asked to run this program...in an environment that ran 24/7.&amp;nbsp; In the interest of appeasing vendor support, John did run it, but not until imposing some limits on how high &amp;quot;f&amp;quot; could go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6381"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6381&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<title>The Great Excel Spreadsheet</title>

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wtf_imgfloatright" style="float: right; margin: 5px" alt="Photo Credit: 'pit-yacker' at Flickr" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/bank.jpg" /&gt;Fresh out of school, &lt;b&gt;Maxim&lt;/b&gt; was able to score himself a pretty sweet entry level position in a small private bank. Rather than&amp;nbsp;being responsible for maintaining the company's static phone book&amp;nbsp;on the&amp;nbsp;corporate intranet&amp;nbsp;or some other stereotypical entry level thing, he was placed in the understaffed Publications department to do some surprisingly heavy impacting IT work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The department's job was to produce and distribute various financial reports including the most important one of all - the Recommendation List. This list was considered mission critical for the bank as it contained the official recommendations of what stocks and bonds to buy or sell and was sent out to managers and customers alike. A bad recommendation could make or break the financial managers, not to mention the customers whom invested their money with the bank, who made decisions based on this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the core of the Recommendation List was the Great Excel Spreadsheet (or &amp;quot;G.E.S.&amp;quot; as it was known internally). Its existence was so crucial that it even had its own dedicated employee, Helen, the Report Editor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each week, the Helen's dance would go like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;First she would send the spreadsheet to a team of Analysts who would make adjustments based on their &amp;quot;insight&amp;quot; of the market.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Once returned to the Editor, she would then run a macro that would update stock and bond values from a data provider.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;This spreadsheet would then be returned to the Analysts for re-verification.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;If everything was in order, it would be sent to the print shop and then snail mailed to managers every week and to their private customers monthly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all of this back and forth, Management felt that this process was ripe for improvement. So, armed with a copy of Access for the front end and a SQL Server account to handle everything on the back end, Maxim went to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Never Underestimate the Power of Yield&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;The original developer of the G.E.S. was long gone by the time Maxim showed up, but this wasn't much of a problem. Amid the ocean of financial mumbo-jumbo, he found good comments and descriptively named data fields. From a technical perspective, everything was clear except for one field - Yield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The information surrounding Yield was more cautionary than helpful. The formula's description, for example, simply read &amp;quot;DO NOT EVER ATTEMPT TO CHANGE THIS CALCULATION! EVER!&amp;quot; Looking for some useful information, Maxim turned to the analysts for some help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh, God!&amp;quot; the lead analyst cringed, &amp;quot;you're not touching the Yield!?! Oh no no no, don't touch that! That's the most important part of the whole spreadsheet!!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a bit more prodding, he learned that the Yield was the magic number that influenced the Analysts' decision to recommend a stock or bond. Thankfully, Maxim was able to port over the function that calculated the yield value alone and very soon, he was on his way to making his new application live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 style="margin-bottom: 0px"&gt;Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle...of Copy-and-Pasting into Spreadsheets?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p style="margin-top: 0px"&gt;With a month's worth of experience under his belt, Maxim's project was coming along quite well.&amp;nbsp; Everybody loved using the pretty Access front end with its drop-downs and he had created instead of the ominous facade of the Great Excel Spreadsheet. Even Helen was satisfied since she now had more of purpose than pushing paper out week after week! However, the joy was short-lived, as was revealed during an emergency department meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lead analyst started, &amp;quot;Maxim, we're finding some discrepancies in the report.&amp;nbsp; Several values in what we're finding to be random stocks and bonds are being grossly misrepresented.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How do you mean?&amp;quot; asked Maxim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Point blank - we believe that YOU broke the Yield calculation and we're two days away from sending out bad figures that could ruin the bank and its investors.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After having to awkwardly sit through the rest of the meeting where &amp;quot;Plan B&amp;quot; (resurrect Helen) was discussed, Maxim got to work looking for a root cause.&amp;nbsp; Skeptical that the database would calculate some fields incorrectly, Maxim manually worked out the values by hand and found the problem and found the biggest shocker of all - some of the formulas in the original spreadsheet were wrong to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In going back previous editions of the spreadsheet, somehow, they managed to send completely idiotic numbers to their customers for three full years (at least). Not a single customer, not a single manager ever noticed the inconsistency for what were supposed to be trivial multiplications; not a single one of them noticed that &amp;quot;The-most-important-figure-on-this-chart-we-base-all-our-decisions-on&amp;quot; was random garbage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end, he found out that whenever Helen needed to create a new row, she would simply copy and paste some random row and then adjust the values. At some point, however, she must have messed up and the spreadsheet ended up in a weird state, with formulas referring to cells in other rows, or sometimes even referring to nothing, creating a whole bunch of inconsistent values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excited at the chance to clear his name, Maxim revealed his findings to the lead analyst.&amp;nbsp; However, instead of relief, he only shrugged and responded &amp;ldquo;Hmph... well, we usually just use our gut for recommendations, anyway.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brought to you by the &lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx"&gt;Non-WTF Job Board&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/rsslink.ashx?PubPostId=6375"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/img.ashx?PubPostId=6375&amp;Record=False" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			<description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hmmm,&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt; pondered, &amp;quot;the 4-minute Shrimp takes 10 minutes to prep and 7 minutes to cook... maybe it only takes 4 minutes to eat?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/errord/pic1.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;After waiting fifteen minutes for a bus at my local station,&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Johnno&lt;/b&gt; writes, &amp;quot;I figured that there was something wrong. I checked the sign for delays and, as I thought, the bus timedout.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://img.thedailywtf.com/images/200812/errord/10052008044.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Every time I refreshed the page,&amp;quot; &lt;b&gt;Arlen Phillips&lt;/b&gt; wrote, &amp;quot;the number of seconds I was told to wait grew by exactly 6000000000000000000. I gave up after at 156000000000000000000 seconds, which, according Google, is slightly under 5 trillion years. I can wait, I guess...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dotan Cohen&lt;/b&gt; (דותן כהן) received this great tip. &amp;quot;Had I known this,&amp;quot; he added, &amp;quot;I might have tried something different.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;YK&lt;/b&gt; appreciated that the Hong Kong airport puts a serious effort in testing cleaniness.&lt;/p&gt;
