			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All of <strong>Georgia&#8217;s</strong> Apple stores are clustered within a 27-mile circle north and east of Atlanta, but not for long. Apple will open a retail store at the <strong>Augusta Mall</strong> in that city, 125 miles east of Atlanta. The 1.1 million square-foot mall along Interstate 20 is operated by General Growth Properties, and features 134 shops. The mall completed a Main Street-type expansion and renovation (The Augusta Promenade) last month, where Apple could open by July 2009.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple will fill in coverage of its retail stores in the area south of Puget Sound (Wash.) when they locate a store inside the <strong>Tacoma Mall</strong> in that city. The mall is located along Interstate 5, and has just completed a 100,000 square-foot lifestyle expansion where Apple may locate. The Seattle region is now served by four Apple stores, but they are all along the eastern rim of Puget Sound and at least 25 miles from Tacoma. The store could open by July 2009.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The local Apple reseller in <strong>Santa Barbara</strong> (Calif.) may see his sales drop 30 percent in the first year after a new Apple retail store opens in the city next Spring. The CraigSmithBlog.com Web site interviewed <strong>Mac Mechanic</strong> owner Mike Bishop, who estimates Apple is spending $2 million to reconstruct the building at 928 State Street, and signed a 10-year lease for $67,000 a month. &#8220;The future looks kind of bleak,&#8221; Bishop told Smith. He recently purchased the building he was formerly renting, and renovated the interior to closely match Apple&#8217;s own stores. He says his profit margin is just eight percent, which Apple stores can undercut simply by offering the company&#8217;s standard 10 percent educational discount. &#8220;It&#8217;s not fair!&#8221; Bishop said. Resellers in other cities have seen a 20 to 30 percent decline in business after the arrival of an Apple store, he said.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The battle for customers among Apple retailers is heating up, with prices posted at on-line resellers <strong>dropping</strong> below the only discount that Apple offers&#8211;for education customers. The price competition means that price-matching at Apple&#8217;s retail stores is now even more important for the company to maintain the retail segment&#8217;s revenues. Reseller <strong>MacMall</strong> has &#8220;slashed&#8221; prices to Black Friday levels again for a limited time, and virtually all are below Apple&#8217;s <strong>educational</strong> discount. <strong>Amazon.com</strong> is offering more low-key discounts of up to six percent plus a $100 rebate on Macbook Pro models, only a slight discount on iMacs, but almost a seven percent discount on Mac Pros. Check the chart after the break.<br />
<span id="more-3856"></span><br />
Here are retail prices on three Mac models as of December 6, 2008 at 8 p.m., based on the resellers&#8217; Web site. You must factor in sales tax for Apple stores, Amazon.com (five states) and MacMall (three states), and any shipping for the on-line resellers (Apple is free).</p>
<p>Of course, Apple benefits regardless of who sells their products.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A huge crowd packed the plaza in front of the new <strong>Rosenstrasse</strong> (Munich) retail store Saturday morning to await the moment when the door swung open for the first time. The weather was cold, but there was no rain or snow to dampen the spirits of the crowd. There were reportedly 4,000 visitors to the store within the first four hours. <strong>Dennis Voss</strong>, a veteran of several other grand openings in Europe and the United States, started the overnight waiting line at 1:30 a.m. and was first through the doors when the store opened at 10 a.m. Check photos of the waiting line and the grand opening on the setteB.IT <a title="Rosenstrasse grand opening" href="http://www.setteb.it/news-Folla-interminabile-per-l-Apple-Store-di-Monaco-2008-12-05-005308.xhtml">Web site</a>, these flickr sets by <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/smokeonit/sets/72157610821408068/">smokeonit</a> and <a title="Rosenstrasse opening by Oifi74" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/oifi/tags/store/">Oifi74</a> and <a title="Rosenstrasse Apple store" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mki/tags/store/">Isik</a>, and this amazing panoramic <a title="Rosenstrasse grand opening panorama" href="http://homepage.mac.com/wkaemena/FS/Muenchen/AppleMUC1/" target="_blank">QTVR</a> of the storefront.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There&#8217;s a festive holiday mood in front of the Apple store on <strong>Rosenstrasse</strong> in Munich (Germany), as passersby stare into the windows where workers are making final preparation for Saturday morning&#8217;s grand opening. Several buildings are outlined with lights and the nearby Marienplatz square is decorated with a huge iPod nano &#8220;dripping colors&#8221; poster. On Friday evening Apple held the traditional VIP reception that includes business and city leaders. The weather at 11 p.m. local time is clear and 37°F., and will eventually dip down to 33°F. overnight. Saturday&#8217;s forecast is 39°F. and a chance of rain.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Demolition work is complete, and workers are erecting steel on a 7,496 square-foot building across from the existing <strong>Bethesda Row</strong> (Md.) mini-store that will become Apple&#8217;s new home in the district. Apple&#8217;s architectural representative was granted a building permit on July 18, 2008 for work on 4860 Bethesda Avenue, and estimated the building construction cost as $1,175,689, not including electrical, plumbing and other related work. According to plans and the structural steel that&#8217;s now erected, the building will be two levels, with corporate meeting and training rooms upstairs. The current store is one of nine very small stores that opened in 2004, but which shoppers say is now too small to handle the growing crowds of Apple visitors. Based on construction progress, the new store site, it could open in mid-2009. Photos of the construction work after the break.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Rumors of an expansion of the <strong>Christiana</strong> (Del.) Apple retail store, the economic recession and the mall&#8217;s plans for expansion provide a case study in how <strong>bad</strong> times for America might actually be <strong>good</strong> times for the Apple stores. General Growth Properties Inc., who manages the mall, today announced they received an extension on $58 million of debt, but the company is skirting with bankruptcy, analysts say. The company owes over $3 billion during the next two years. GGP already has announced cancellation of a new space at Christiana that would have tried to hook into Internet-based selling. But it insists that a previously-announced 200,000 square-foot <strong>expansion</strong> is on-track, which could provide a new, larger space for Apple at attractive rates. Or Apple could simply move into vacant spaces will start appearing in the mall.</p>
<p><span id="more-3773"></span></p>
<p>Macy&#8217;s says they may close 10 stores next year to help float over the downturn, and Circuit City says they&#8217;ll close 155 stores as part of a vicious slashing to prevent going out of business entirely. Scores of other large businesses are closing selected locations to cut expenses, and perhaps hundreds of small businesses aren&#8217;t even thinking about the future&#8211;they&#8217;re closing for good and vacating their spaces.</p>
<p>GGP&#8217;s chief financial officer left the company in October&#8211;the company did not explain the circumstances, but began a series of maneuvers to meet debt repayment deadlines. A plan to convert 180,000 square-feet of former Lord &amp; Taylor space into a so-called &#8220;Epicenter&#8221; boutique shopping area have been cancelled, GGP executives say. The area was to have highlighted products normally available on the Internet or in catalogs.</p>
<p>The $125 million mall expansion plan in still a &#8220;go,&#8221; GGP says, and is scheduled for a November 2009 opening. They say the project began last year, and is intended to support the malls long-term sales goals. Barnes &amp; Noble is penciled in for over 33,000 square-feet in the new expansion, along with LUSH, XXI Forever and a new food court. Nordstrom will open in 2011 in the former Strawbridge&#8217;s location.</p>
<p>As for Apple, a larger space may be as near as its next-door neighbor. The Christiana mall plan labels both stores to the left of the existing, 30-foot-wide Apple store as &#8220;Vacant.&#8221; Expanding into the two spaces would add 4,750 square-feet to the existing 3,410 square-feet, an increase of 230 percent, and give Apple an impressive 70-foot storefront. Shoppers at the store say it is always crowded and needs more room.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignright" title="2008 Holidays" src="http://www.ifoapplestore.com/photos/2008_holiday_tb.gif" alt="" width="140" height="149" />Shoppers seemed to be flocking to Apple&#8217;s retail stores on <strong>Black Friday</strong>, drawn specifically by discounts on laptops and iPods, and perhaps by price-matching. Visits to stores in the San Francisco area confirmed that <strong>all</strong> employees were on-deck to help provide service to the crowds of people, including about 20 who showed up at 3 a.m. (26 degrees!) to shop at the Jordan Creek (Iowa) store. The stores had a grab-and-go table of iPods, iPhones and laptops to speed purchases, a holiday gift brochure to hand out, and both an iPhone and One to One gift card. Since Apple doesn&#8217;t report monthly sales figures, the success of Black Friday will be rolled in to quarterly figures, which aren&#8217;t released until mid-January 2009.<span id="more-3735"></span></p>
<p>The retail research firm ShopperTrak RCT Corp. reported that Black Friday sales were up three percent from the same day of 2007. Apple is a participant in the ShopperTrak system of computer-based  visitor tracking, although it&#8217;s not clear if Apple also reports sales to the company.</p>
<p>Visitors to the stores confirmed they were able to trim up to $200 off the price of some products by <strong>verbally</strong> referring to the prices of other Apple authorized resellers under the stores&#8217; price-matching policy. Even without printed documentation, employees referred to resellers&#8217; Web sites to confirm the lower prices, and apparently had to obtain a manager&#8217;s approval. The Amazon.com Web site seemed to be popular among buyers as their price-matching partner.</p>
<p>Some shoppers also reported discounts on other major hardware, including 10 percent off hard drives.</p>
<p>Here is a selection of store collateral that was available to holiday shoppers on Black Friday.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple has posted special <strong>Black Friday</strong> discount prices on its Australia and UK Web store site, offering price reductions ranging from just 4.1 percent to 7.7 percent on selected models of iPods, Apple TVs, Macbooks and iMacs. The discounts may be similar to those offered in Apple&#8217;s retail stores around the world as they open on Friday. An analysis by the <a title="ZDnet - Black Friday discounts" href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/hardware/?p=3096">ZDnet</a> Web site show <strong>no</strong> pattern to the discounts, the highest discount is on the 2.0 GHz Macbook, and there are <strong>no</strong> price reductions on Macbook Pro or Mac Pro models. Apple is offering <strong>higher</strong> discounts on certain software (Photoshop Elements 6 is 42% off), speakers, headphones, computer bags and iPod cases. [The Italian on-line store discounts seem to be slightly higher. <strong>Update</strong>: In-store prices are posted, and they are very similar to the Australia and UK discounts, and are limited to the same set of products.]</p>

The three-dimensional, five-foot figures are intricately designed and feature neon-lit, glowing headphone cords that were fabricated by the Brooklyn-based company <a href="http://litebriteneon.com/">Lite Brite Neon</a>. Store employees receive the figures in pieces, and must install the various parts, including rigging the USB and power wires for the neon and iPod display. The company posted instructional videos for store employees, explaining the process of pulling the wires through the figures and powering up the neon.

Tipsters say the store will open either December 6th or 10th. Check photos after the break.<span id="more-3695"></span></p>
