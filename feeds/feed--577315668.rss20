      <title>You are Not A Unique Snowflake</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>After reading Steve&#8217;s post, <a href="http://howtosplitanatom.com/news/great-lives-are-sitcoms/">Great Lives Are Sitcoms</a> it prompted me to think a lot about why many are resistant to the idea of branding, or specifically, <a href="http://www.artofselfbranding.com/">self-branding.</a></p>

	<p>I think the biggest problem people have with this concept is that we really, truly want to be <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/quotes">the unique snowflake.</a> We don&#8217;t want to summarize ourselves in five words, a sentence, or hell, even a paragraph. It&#8217;s always got to be the memoir-length novel to disguise insecurity that we can&#8217;t possibly be compartmentalized, categorized, etc. No! We are all different, because nothing&#8217;s worse than being all the same, right?</p>

	<p>No one wants to be the &#8220;archetype&#8221; but archetypes are the ones that people notice. Most importantly, they&#8217;re the ones that people understand <em>immediately</em>.</p>

	<p>However, what people don&#8217;t understand is that we <em>are</em> all <em>generally</em> the same (great thing about being human), with similar trials/tribulations: the difference is all in the execution. It&#8217;s the same with all television shows and sitcoms: the &#8220;plot&#8221; is the same (man vs. man; man vs. machine; man vs. society; man vs. environment) but the <span class="caps">STORY</span> is different.</p>

	<p>I think more people need to understand that the front cover of a book, and the brief synopsis at the back cover, is what makes people want to read the entire novel. People should never be afraid of 5 word summaries, because if it&#8217;s pretty good, people will want more.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Countdown to Lealea 2.0</title>
      <link>http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/countdown&#45;to&#45;lealea&#45;20/</link>
      <description>It&#39;s coming, really it is.</description>
      <dc:subject>News</dc:subject>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>I just wanted to send a note to my loyal readers that Lealea 2.0 is finally coming. I have set up a <a href="http://test.lealea.net/">development domain</a> (you can&#8217;t see it because it&#8217;s set for SuperAdmins to view) using <a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=lealea">ExpressionEngine&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://expressionengine.com/downloads/details/multiple_site_manager/">Multiple Site Manager.</a>  so that I can use the same install and also plug in my current lealea.net content into there just to see how it looks. If you <em>really really</em> want a preview, just <a href="/contact/">send me an e-mail</a> and I might actually show you a screenshot. :)</p>

	<p>However, this is not without its pitfalls: this new site will be playing aroundnd with the current EE install and that may mean mistakes like plugins not working or pages getting shuffled, etc. In fact, in my zeal, <del>I&#8217;ve already accidentally deleted my latest post about &#8220;My First Website&#8221; along with its comments</del> it&#8217;s been restored! yay!&#8230; </p>

	<p>I&#8217;ve already implemented the homepage and my about page. Designed, coded, and working in EE. :-) It&#8217;s also using <a href="http://novemberborn.net/sifr3/beta2">sIFR 3</a> for the typeface and I have to say, wow, what a difference! I plan to be optimizing my blog section, and then finally, working on my projects pages. When that is complete, I&#8217;ll launch 2.0. And yes, I&#8217;ll write a blog post outlining what has improved from Ver 1 to Ver 2, including some <a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/index.php?affiliate=lealea">ExpressionEngine details.</a></p>

	<p>The big question is: when? The best answer I can give is <del>early October</del> edit: <em>I suck. Honestly think it will be before the end of the year.</em> With the momentum I have, I think that can actually be a safe bet. I&#8217;m really excited about this next iteration and I just want to take the time to thank all my loyal visitors, clients, and friends who have graced my website and helped my business get to where it is now.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My First Website</title>
      <link>http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/my&#45;first&#45;website/</link>
      <description>Does anyone remember theirs?</description>
      <dc:subject>Design, Web</dc:subject>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Does anyone remember their first website? I mean, really remember?</p>

	<p>I think I remember my first website more than I remember other &#8220;firsts&#8221; in my life. What better way to encompass the 90s than in a website loading on Netscape 1.0. As a thirteen year old brimming with optimism and geeky passtimes, I always tried to find ways to marry several interests in one. The web, even back then, was a way to do all that.</p>

	<p>My first website was a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon">Sailor Moon</a> fan site. Coded together on Microsoft Notepad on a Pentium I computer on Windows 95, using screenshots and images downloaded on a 14.4 baud modem. The search engine of choice was <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">Web Crawler</a> I remember clicking to download a 200KB image and leaving to have lunch. This first website was a dark color schemed one &#8212; basically, also showing my bias with light on dark designs early on.</p>

	<p>It was also hosted on <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">Geocities</a> back when they only offered 2MB of space. I believe the site was nestled in a community called &#8220;Tokyo Ginza&#8221; page 5437. I, unfortunately, do not have any screenshots to show you of this beauteous creation. It has been lost to the abyss of the web and old junky computer parts.</p>

	<p>What was your first website?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Blogging about Blogging</title>
      <link>http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/blogging&#45;about&#45;blogging/</link>
      <description>It goes full circle.</description>
      <dc:subject>Business, Web, Etcetera</dc:subject>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>I&#8217;ve been invited to speak at two different conferences about blogging. <a href="http://www.caj.ca/events/2008/">The Canadian Association of Journalists</a> invited me to speak about blogging as &#8220;the new normal&#8221; and I&#8217;ll be heading to Orlando, FL for <a href="http://www.izeafest.com/"><span class="caps">IZEA</span>fest</a> to discuss how to increase traffic to your blog. But as my kind and generous readers know, I&#8217;m not your typical prolific blogger &#8212; I don&#8217;t post every single day, or every week, or even every month. However, according to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com/">Feedburner</a> I still have around 500 subscribers, almost 3000 unique visits a month, and I get inquiries from businesses wondering if I could put ads on my blog or write-up something about their company. I also have almost 340 followers on Twitter.</p>

	<p>Now what does this say about blogging &#8212; or in the case of Twitter, micro-blogging &#8212; have anything to do with anything if I&#8217;m not as frequent as I could (should?) be?  I am no pro-blogger and some will scoff at the &#8220;low&#8221; numbers I&#8217;m citing, but the bottom line is this: people that <em>I want to know</em>, know who I am and still, for whatever reason, care about what I have to say. Blogging has given me a place to express my opinions, which in turn, resulted in various opportunities for my personal life (friends) and my career (clients and conferences).</p>

	<p>I believe the reason why, despite the fact that I haven&#8217;t written 500 posts and don&#8217;t blog every day, I still get steady visitors &#8212; old and new &#8212; as well as great opportunities, are two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>a genuine, approachable voice &#8212; I don&#8217;t preen/pretend or write too formally</li>
<li>quality content &#8212; when I <em>do</em> post something, people actually reply or link to it or discuss it</li>
</ol>

	<p>Now, when you think about that signal to noise ratio, it&#8217;s a lot like when you pitch a design project to a client. In your own time, you experimented with different layouts and styles, but you end up only showing them one or two. That way, you make sure you only show the one you feel is most appropriate for them; the one you put the most thought into. I have a running text file with possible blog posts I may write in the future, but beyond the obvious time constraints for work and life, I also think about when is it most appropriate to write. Sometimes I decide to post something because everyone else is making a comment about that particular point like I did with <a href="http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/lack-of-a-shared-vocabulary/">Lack of a Shared Vocabulary</a>. This way you can &#8220;share&#8221; the traffic because you are riding a wave of what&#8217;s &#8220;current.&#8221; However, it is also good to bring up a new point I haven&#8217;t found others speaking about at all or for a long time, like I did with <a href="http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/handling-rejection/">Handling Rejection</a> to <em>begin</em> the conversation, and if original, will get you a lot of links. Speaking of which, each post, while not always consciously targeted, can be maximized if you do narrow your focus for your blog. Current and past clients read my blog, and they often cite certain things I wrote as part of the reason why they chose me/still work with me because it was a quick and easy way for them to realize what my professional values were.</p>

	<p>Until then, I&#8217;m always trying to balance where I can best spend my time. Having a blog can be a <a href="http://www.problogger.net/">full time job</a> and because it isn&#8217;t my choice career stream, I would rather ensure I post something I feel people would benefit from rather than filling the space for the sake of filling space.</p>

	<p>That&#8217;s my two cents. Thoughts? Agree/Disagree? :)</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>More SXSW stuff &#45;&#45; my presentation article at Digital Web and Sunny Gault interviews me during SXSW!</description>
      <dc:subject>Business, Design, Web</dc:subject>

pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></embed>	<p>Nope, this isn&#8217;t a <span class="caps">CSS</span> Naked Day post. I don&#8217;t have anything wrong with <span class="caps">CSS</span> Naked Day, I just like the pretty, so it stays up. :) Speaking of looks, this site design has aged pretty well considering I still get a lot of compliments on it&#8230; however, I also understand a long overdue re-align is needed. Truthfully, I wanted to launch right before <span class="caps">SXSW</span> and I do have a new design in the works! Yes, the main direction of the design is actually finished but due to making sure I got other projects off the ground I had to post-pone the new design. A few of you may have already gotten a sneak peek at where it&#8217;s going. I am pretty excited, so please stick around. I am hoping to have the new site launched in the next couple of months (darn you, paying clients that take priority&#8230; I kid, I love you all)</p>

	<p>What this post really is about is the <a href="http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/back-to-life-back-to-reality/">aforementioned summary of my presentation</a>. Digital Web published my article, <a href="http://www.digital-web.com/articles/presenting_preparation_process_pizzazz/">Presenting: Preparation, Process, and Pizzazz</a> (Can you tell I love alliteration?) There, I outline the process I took to preparing for <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, questions I asked myself, my goals, outcome, and some reaction to the presentation. I hope you enjoy!</p>

	<p>Also, Sunny Gault, host of <a href="http://www.veoh.com/channels/viral">Veoh Viral TV</a> interviewed me during <span class="caps">SXSW</span> to talk a little about me, branding, and my presentation! She is super nice and easy to talk to. The video is finally up online. Take a look! (Though, I have to say, lighting can be unforgiving&#8230;)</p>

      <description>Lealea Design returns from SXSWi 2008! A very brief overview.</description>
      <dc:subject>Business, Design, Web, Etcetera</dc:subject>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Let me get it out right away: this <span class="caps">SXSW</span> was better than the last. Every year, <span class="caps">SXSW</span> grows by leaps and bounds, but despite that, I actually seemed to manage to do what seemed to be <em>less</em> this year and yet, gained <em>more.</em> Essentially, I attended less panels, but the ones I did were pretty awesome. I also attended less parties, exchanged less business cards , and hung out with only a few peeps compared to last. In the end, it was a much better experience. Less scattered, more genuine.</p>

	<p>Here is my overview.</p>

<h3>Notable were:</h3> 

<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewthread/73632/">EE 2.0 reveal</a> with a new <a href="http://www.jquery.com/">jQuery enhanced</a> Control Panel designed by <a href="http://veerle.duoh.com/">Veerle Pieters</a>, and its naughty bits built on top of <a href="http://codeigniter.com/">CodeIgniter</a> (insert fangirlish squeal here)</li><li><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060492">The Art of Speed</a> moderated by <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/">Tim Ferris</a> was one of the few panels I felt that seemed tightly controlled with great speakers and what seemed to be tangible and actionable tips. Biggest lesson? &#8220;Companies are defeated by internal conflict, more than external.&#8221; The only thing you should never speed through is building relationships with your colleagues and smoothing out any internal conflict. Also: <em>don&#8217;t</em> have 100% of your time filled. That leaves little room to be reactive and flexible.</li><li><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060512">Kathy Sierra</a> This woman is what I call a total pro in presentation. She is where the bar is set. Amazingly inspirational, fun, and informative.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Not so fun:</h3>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&id=IAP060527">What Women Need to Succeed</a> could have been so much more. They qualified at the beginning that this wouldn&#8217;t devolve into men bashing, but I felt as if it did just that. I wish there was more emphasis on how different women <em>define success</em>, and more stories of their personal journeys. Instead, it felt more like the same old bitching and moaning. A huge difference from last year&#8217;s <em>more empowering</em> panel, <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels/?action=show&id=IAP060126">Boss Lady</a> where I felt there were more tangible and dare I say, <em>ethical</em>, ideas on how to succeed as a woman in business.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Internet famous? (kidding)</h3>

	<p>I can has interviews? Haha. First of all, I was featured on <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A597185">The Austin Chronicle</a> where I shared my thoughts about branding, and viral video backlash. Also, <a href="http://www.styledash.com/">Styledash&#8217;s Jonathon Morgan</a> took me aside during the conference to ask my thoughts about what I consider &#8220;geek chic&#8221; and some geeky style talk. A lot of fun. The article isn&#8217;t up yet, but I will plug it when available. On top of that all, I managed to spend half an hour with <a href="http://www.veoh.com/channels/viral">Sunny Gault</a> and their <span class="caps">SXSW</span> partner <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/virallive">ustream.tv</a> to talk a little bit about branding and my panel on Monday morning. That interview should be recorded and when I have it up, I&#8217;ll also show that link.</p>

	<h3>The Art of Self-Branding</h3>

	<p>I will only briefly gloss over this for now because I believe this deserves a separate blog post. At any rate, I will consider this panel a relative success: despite a morning thunderstorm after a long night of partying, I had a pretty good crowd welcoming me, where the majority also stuck around. :) I want to thank everyone who got up to go and for all the questions asked after the presentation, and all the comments and feedback. I always strive to get better every time I speak, and so your feedback &#8212; good or not-so-good &#8212; is always appreciated. I will go into detail about that in a post, soon. And yes, the slides will be up very soon on Wednesday afternoon on <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/lealea">Slideshare</a> and on <a href="http://www.artofselfbranding.com/">artofselfbranding.com</a></p>

	<h3><span class="caps">SXSW</span> Volunteers</h3>

	<p>I want to specifically thank <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/fajalar/2332134782/">Maria</a>, the super cool volunteer who helped me to my panel and time it; as well as the hard working tech crew &#8212; a small glitch in sound during my presentation was immediately fixed. I also want to say hello to Wei! We need to really extend our warmest appreciation to these hardworking folks for keeping <span class="caps">SXSW</span> as smoothly running as possible. I am glad I had a chance to hang out with the behind-the-sceners to get an inside scoop on some of the process for <span class="caps">SXSW</span>.</p>

	<h3>Shenanigans</h3>

	<p>And finally, and most importantly, I have to say everyone I hung out with is SO awesome. I mean, who knew that my hapless group of friends would <a href="http://www.icecreamman.com/article/detail/SXSW-Interactive-Opening-Night-MACC">end up getting a free ride in an ice cream truck</a> Individual shoutouts are lame, because you all know who you are and Flickr will have evidence. My final word on this? <a href="http://www.bixbyheart.com/">Bixbyheart.com</a></p>

	<p>Another year, another <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, and I hope that even with its continued growth, that <span class="caps">SXSW</span> manages to keep a tight hold on its awesomeness. Take some advice from <a href="http://designeye.org/sxswi/">Design Eye</a> though, please? That would be great!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The Trek to Austin Commences</title>
      <link>http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/the&#45;trek&#45;to&#45;austin&#45;commences/</link>
      <description>Lealea Design at SXSWi 2008!</description>
      <dc:subject>Design</dc:subject>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>For those who don&#8217;t already know, I will be in Austin, TX for <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/"><span class="caps">SXSW</span> 2008</a> I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to have many friends, colleagues, and curious attenders vote to have my panel, <a href="http://2008.sxsw.com/interactive/programming/panels_schedule/?action=show&amp;id=IAP060491">The Art of Self-Branding</a> put on the schedule (Monday, March 10 @ 10 am!), so I owe a lot to everyone who&#8217;s supported me to get on stage. I can&#8217;t believe that this just my second time to Southby, but I can&#8217;t wait!</p>

	<p>For those interested, you can have a peek at my tentative schedule: <a href="http://sched.org/sxsw2008/lealea">http://sched.org/sxsw2008/lealea</a></p>

	<p>I will be arrive March 7th in the late afternoon and leaving early Tuesday morning on the 11th. If you want to give me a shout or meet up or whatever, please feel free to leave me your contact info and I&#8217;d be more than happy to chit chat.</p>

	<p>I notice that there&#8217;s a <a href="http://airbagindustries.com/archives/airbag/hampton.php">few</a> <a href="meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2008/02/22/south-bypass/">prominent</a> people deciding to pass on <span class="caps">SXSW</span> this year, for various number of reasons, and this is why I have a few tips for those attending for the first time based on my experience:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Bring lots of business cards, remember to have it on your person</li>
		<li>Leave your laptop in the room, but bring a notepad/moleskin/etc and pen; you want to be really nimble and mobile</li>
		<li>Swallow your shyness and approach people! Say hi! At the end of the day, no matter who the person is, we&#8217;re all just a bunch of geeks.</li>
		<li><span class="caps">APPROACH</span> the panelists after the talk! They don&#8217;t bite. In fact, most are super nice and invite you out to lunch .</li>
		<li>Don&#8217;t succumb to peer pressure to stay later than you feel comfortable or party more than you care to. If you&#8217;re tired at 10 pm, go to your hotel room and sleep!</li>
		<li>I&#8217;m not quite the teetotaler, but just because some of the booze is free doesn&#8217;t mean you need to indulge (or indulge too much). :-P People will still be there the next day and probably will appreciate the fact that you aren&#8217;t a) hungover, or b) looking like death warmed over. And please, remember, this is still a relatively professional setting. No matter how great a designer you are, if you act like an ass, I&#8217;ll be less likely to collaborate/hire/work with you.</li>
		<li>Be <span class="caps">VERY</span> choosy which panels you go to. You are under no obligation to <span class="caps">STAY</span> the entire course of a panel if you hate it. Just stand up and walk out. It&#8217;s okay.</li>
		<li>In fact, only go to a handful of panels. The main point is to meet and greet. :)</li>
		<li>There&#8217;s also a lot of free food given away during <span class="caps">SXSW</span>, so if you keep your eyes and ears open to which parties those may be &#8212; go there. I know I can&#8217;t resist the lure of free, especially if it involves food</li>
	</ul>

	<p>And I think that&#8217;s about it, the quick and dirty tips. So, have fun, everyone and please go to my panel if you have a chance! Woot!</p>

	<p><strong>edit:</strong> How can I forget? Bad, Lea! I am heading to <span class="caps">SXSW</span> this year again through the generosity of <a href="http://www.digitalalberta.com/">Digital Alberta</a> and <a href="http://www.ciaic.ca/">The Canadian Interactive Alliance</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>Once upon a time, I used to dabble in <a href="http://www.wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> As it is one of the most popular blog software around, I couldn&#8217;t <em>not</em> fiddle with it even a tiny bit. It wasn&#8217;t my favourite software (<a href="http://www.expressionengine.com/">EE holds my heart</a>) but one of my friends needed a new theme to spice up her blog and she insisted on WP.</p>

	<p>Kristine is a brilliant writer, and is currently working through the <span class="caps">JET</span> program as a teacher in Japan. She wanted something that was feminine, but dark, with a hint of that Japanese flavour. And thus, the <strong>Murasaki theme</strong> was born. However, she&#8217;s moved on from the theme and now we want to release it to the world!</p>	<p><img src="http://www.lealea.net/images/posts/screenshot.png" width="300" height="383" /></p>

	<p><a href="http://dev.lealea.net/murasaki/">Preview here</a> | <a href="/downloads/lealea-murasaki.zip">Download here</a></p>

	<p>It&#8217;s a simple enough theme: rounded corners, stylized dates, and simple image. It&#8217;s easily customizable &#8212; and one of my friends even mentioned that it&#8217;s one of the cleanest coded themes she&#8217;s seen. :) That&#8217;s the simplicity and beauty of it. So, if you want a piece of Murasaki, it&#8217;s <strong><span class="caps">FREE</span></strong>. It is being released under a fairly <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/ca/">open CC license</a> : The Creative Commons Attribution 2.5 Canada</p>

	<p>This means you can do whatever you want with the theme, but it would be nice if you kept the link back pointing to Lealea Design in the footer. :)</p>

	<p>So, please enjoy this theme. Let me know if you&#8217;ve implemented it in the comments.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <description>Personality is King. Content is Queen.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>So Scrivs knows <a href="http://3by9.com/53/i-know-what-is-king/">what is king.</a> I&#8217;ll spoil it for you: it isn&#8217;t content. Wait wait, hear him out. It makes sense. Content is just <em>part</em> of the overall big picture of what drives people to visit your site, or use your services, or what-have-you. It is important. But it isn&#8217;t &#8220;king.&#8221;</p>

	<p>It&#8217;s Queen. And the King and Queen can&#8217;t work without each other&#8230; or the rest of the Royal Court.</p>	<p>I won&#8217;t go into more details about why content isn&#8217;t king &#8212; <a href="http://3by9.com/53/i-know-what-is-king/">Scrivs does a good job</a> and <a href="http://3by9.com/53/i-know-what-is-king/#comment-123">Derek Powazek</a> emphasizes the point further that it&#8217;s all about relationships&#8230; but Scrivs makes a good statement: &#8220;Makes me wonder who the prince, princess and court jester are now.&#8221;</p>

	<p>While he was probably just jesting, it did make me think. If Personality is King, and Content is its Queen&#8230; who fills up the rest of the Royal Court that makes a website, blog, service, or person excel?</p>

	<p>Here are my suggestions:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Prince = Process &#8212; how you go about doing things that’s unique</li>
		<li>Princess = Design/Visual Appeal &#8212; gotta look hot to be hot</li>
		<li>Court Jester = Comments/Communication?</li>
		<li>Knight = the heart, culture, and values represented</li>
	</ul>

	<p>My my, this looks pretty similar to what makes a <em>brand</em>&#8230; hmmmmm&#8230; ;-)</p>

	<p>Thoughts?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Handling &#8220;Rejection&#8221;</title>
      <link>http://www.lealea.net/blog/comments/handling&#45;rejection/</link>
      <description>Always with class and dignity.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[	<p>So, someone approaches you for this grand opportunity. It&#8217;s a great project, job, whatever&#8230; You really want it, and you try your hardest to be &#8220;the chosen one&#8221; but at the end of the day, even if they point out you were one of the final two or that they do enjoy your previous work, they decide to go with someone else. Ah, rejection. C&#8217;est la vie, oui? Nothing you can do at this point, right?</p>

	<p>Wrong.</p>	<p>This came to light for me when I was conversing with a friend and colleague of mine about a recent career change. In fact, she revealed that she applied for the same job a few months previous but she was passed over for someone else. Even though she didn&#8217;t get that job, she <em>wrote</em> a personal thank-you note to the people involved for considering her and even personally arrived at the office to give them some cookies. The person at reception thought she actually got the job because she was being so nice, when the opposite was true. She was gracious through and through.</p>

	<p>&#8230; and a few months later, when a contract position opened up in this place, she was immediately called back and subsequently hired. They didn&#8217;t have to waste money <em>or</em> time interviewing her all over again &#8212; they knew who she was. She didn&#8217;t let them <em>forget</em> her because when the first opportunity passed her by, she didn&#8217;t hold any grudges and was also very clever in leaving a great impression.</p>

	<p>When you are approached with a great opportunity and it just slips through your fingers, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s time to pack up shop and immediately move on. Do you do <em>anything</em> after a rejection? Do you write back with a thank you note at the very least? I bet the majority of us, and myself included, just takes the rejection letter/email/phone call and does nothing after. Or, the most is just a &#8220;thank you for your time.&#8221; However, dealing with rejection like this may mean losing future potential projects and positions.</p>

	<p>Here&#8217;s the deal: If you&#8217;ve gotten so far with convincing them with something just to be passed over, that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s an outright rejection of you completely. It may mean that you weren&#8217;t the right fit for the job <em>at the time.</em> Some of us go go through a long interview process, and you passed all these initial hurdles &#8212; that means they actually <em>like</em> you and see something you have to offer. Don&#8217;t immediately throw this away.</p>

	<p>So what did I learn about rejection after this?</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Always be gracious &#8212; there&#8217;s no need to hold grudges</li>
		<li>Always follow up &#8212; either with a phone call or personal written note</li>
		<li>Always leave on a good note, with a good impression &#8212; how you do this is as unique as you are</li>
		<li>Be genuine &#8212; my friend&#8217;s behaviour worked because this is how she actually is in real life with friends, let alone work. People can spot insincerity and that can leave a bad impression.</li>
		<li>Remind them what you offer and that you&#8217;re always available for other projects, positions, etc</li>
		<li>Ask if there&#8217;s anything you could have done differently or why the other person was chosen &#8212; hey, it never hurts to ask, right?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Anyone else have techniques or thoughts on how they handle a rejection?</p>]]></content:encoded>
